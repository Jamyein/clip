I'm going to take a wild guess here and say that you, like me, have a large pile (or digital equivalent) of books or articles you've been meaning to get around to reading, plus maybe a long queue of podcast episodes to which you'd love to listen, if only you had the time. It's the archetypal "first-world problem", I know. But one worth reflecting on – because it's a microcosm of a broader mistake that makes it more stressful than in needs to be to build a fulfilling and productive life: the problem of Too Many Needles.

我要在这里大胆猜测一下，你和我一样，有一大堆（或数字等价物）你一直想抽时间阅读的书籍或文章，也许还有一长串的播客剧集如果你有时间的话，你很想听。我知道，这是典型的“第一世界问题”。但有一个值得反思的地方——因为这是一个更广泛错误的缩影，它让人们比建立充实而富有成效的生活所需的压力更大：“针太多”的问题。

It's amusing to reflect that at an earlier stage in the history of the web, information overload was widely held to be a temporary issue. Yes, true, for the time being we were getting deluged by a zillion irrelevant blog posts, emails and news updates. But that wouldn't last, because soon we'd have better technology for finding what we wanted, while disregarding the rest. The real trouble, according to the leading techno-optimist Clay Shirky, wasn't information overload, but ["filter failure"](https://www.cnet.com/news/shirky-problem-is-filter-failure-not-info-overload/). We needed – and we'd eventually get – more sophisticated ways to filter the wheat from the online chaff. And then we'd no longer feel overwhelmed. 

有趣的是，在网络历史的早期阶段，信息过载被广泛认为是一个暂时的问题。是的，确实如此，目前我们被无数不相关的博客文章、电子邮件和新闻更新所淹没。但这不会持续太久，因为很快我们就会拥有更好的技术来找到我们想要的东西，而忽略其他的东西。根据领先的技术乐观主义者克莱·舍基（Clay Shirky）的说法，真正的问题不是信息过载，而是“过滤失败”。我们需要——而且我们最终会得到——更复杂的方法来从网上的谷壳中过滤出小麦。然后我们就不再感到不知所措。

Yeah… no. I assume you'd agree that the problem of your to-read pile is very much not one of filter failure. It's not that you're deluged with things you don't care about, and need help figuring out what's truly of interest. It's that you're overwhelmed by things you do want to read. All the books on your bedside table, all those bookmarks in your browser, or articles [saved to Instapaper](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=gXmN01MP-roA9DVSSLwwrp0-dobRyQmYwGP4mYTk9dQ.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFwYXBlci5jb20vIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9) – all of them seem like they might be right up your street, or crucial to your professional success, or might contain some nugget of wisdom you'd benefit from absorbing. The problem, as the critic Nicholas Carr [explained](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=1464), isn't filter failure. It's filter success. In a world of effectively infinite information, the better you get at sifting the wheat from the chaff, the more you end up crushed beneath a never-ending avalanche of wheat.

是的……不。我想你会同意你的待读堆的问题很大程度上不是过滤器故障。这并不是说您被不关心的事情淹没，并且需要帮助找出真正感兴趣的事情。而是你对自己想读的东西不知所措。你床头柜上的所有书籍，浏览器中的所有书签，或者保存到 Instapaper 上的文章 - 所有这些看起来都可能是你的家常便饭，或者对你的职业成功至关重要，或者可能包含你的一些智慧。 d 从吸收中受益。正如评论家尼古拉斯·卡尔所解释的那样，问题不在于过滤器故障。过滤成功。在一个信息无限的世界里，你越能从谷壳中筛选出小麦，你就越会被永无休止的小麦雪崩压垮。

And so, for example, the reading recommendations I encounter via Twitter are much more tailored to my concerns than those I might encounter via a newspaper, because I choose who I follow on Twitter; it's like having a thousand assistants scouring the infoverse for whatever might pique my interest. My challenge, information-wise, isn't about finding a needle in a haystack. It's that I'm confronted on a daily basis, in Carr's words, by "haystack-sized piles of needles." 

因此，举例来说，我通过 Twitter 遇到的阅读推荐比我通过报纸遇到的阅读推荐更适合我的担忧，因为我选择在 Twitter 上关注谁；这就像有一千个助手在信息宇宙中搜索任何可能引起我兴趣的东西。从信息角度来说，我面临的挑战并不是大海捞针。用卡尔的话来说，我每天都会遇到“干草堆大小的针头堆”。

The wider point here is that lots of the other ways in which we feel overwhelmed are problems of "too many needles" as well. They involve the attempt to divide our finite time and attention among too many things that all have a legitimate claim on them. Some of these are "good problems to have": for example, if you're blessed with work you love, or a creative passion you're good at, you may often feel torn between multiple projects you're excited to launch. Others are the familiar problems of Life Under Late Capitalism™, like the feeling that there's simply not enough time in the day to be a good parent while staying afloat financially. What they all have in common is that the things you're choosing between all genuinely matter, and would benefit from more time than you can give them.

这里更广泛的一点是，许多其他让我们感到不知所措的方式也是“针太多”的问题。它们试图将我们有限的时间和注意力分配到太多的事情上，而这些事情都有合法的权利。其中一些是“值得拥有的好问题”：例如，如果您有幸拥有自己喜欢的工作，或者擅长的创作热情，那么您可能经常会在多个您兴奋地启动的项目之间感到左右为难。其他问题是《晚期资本主义下的生活》™中常见的问题，比如感觉一天中根本没有足够的时间在维持经济稳定的同时成为一个好父母。它们的共同点是，您在所有事情之间做出的选择都真正重要，并且会从比您给予它们更多的时间中受益。

Too many rocks 石头太多

Unfortunately, most advice on productivity and time management takes the needle-in-a-haystack approach instead. It's about becoming more efficient and organised, or better at prioritising, with the implied promise that you might thereby eliminate or disregard enough of life's unimportant nonsense to make time for the meaningful stuff. To stretch a metaphor: it's about reducing the size of the haystack, to make it easier to focus on the needle.

不幸的是，大多数关于生产力和时间管理的建议都采取了大海捞针的方法。它是关于变得更有效率和更有条理，或者更好地确定优先顺序，并暗示你可能因此消除或忽视生活中足够多的不重要的废话，为有意义的事情腾出时间。打个比喻：就是缩小大海捞针的大小，以便更容易地专注于针。

There's definitely a role for such techniques; but in the end, the only way to deal with a too-many-needles problem is to confront the fact that it's insoluble – that you definitely won't be fitting everything in. (Of course some such problems, where just scraping a living feels impossible, demand political solutions too – a topic for another time.) It's not a question of rearranging your to-do list so as to [make space for all your "big rocks"](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=g9EKf5Lv4dlKvqPm06dCQrm_h5m7KtU3D_wcpDzjNds.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5hcHBsZXNlZWRzLm9yZy9iaWctcm9ja3NfY292ZXkuaHRtIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9), but of accepting that there are simply too many rocks to fit in the jar. You have to take a stab at deciding what matters most, among your various creative passions/life goals/responsibilities – and then do that, while acknowledging that you'll inevitably be neglecting many other things that matter too.

这种技术肯定有其作用。但最终，处理太多针头问题的唯一方法是面对这样一个事实：它是无法解决的——你肯定不会把所有东西都放进去。（当然，有些这样的问题，只是勉强维持生计）这不是重新安排你的待办事项清单以便为所有“大石头”腾出空间的问题，而是接受“石头太多了，无法处理”的问题。适合罐子里。你必须尝试在你的各种创造性热情/生活目标/责任中决定什么是最重要的——然后这样做，同时承认你将不可避免地忽略许多其他也重要的事情。

To return to information overload: this means treating your "to read" pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren't [an overwhelming number of them](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/so/60NWXZixI/c?w=qiSKQRmJJq0-qcwQTuOai0NtmSDVPnNWqEd4D_sHVwI.eyJ1IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmwudWsvYWJvdXQtdXMvb3VyLXN0b3J5L2ZhY3RzLWFuZC1maWd1cmVzLW9mLXRoZS1icml0aXNoLWxpYnJhcnkjIiwiciI6ImEwOGRhOGFkLTlkMTktNGUyYS02OTdhLTE4ODMwZWNhM2JkOCIsIm0iOiJscCJ9), but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.

回到信息过载：这意味着将你的“待读”堆视为一条河流（一条流过你的小溪，你从中或那里挑选一些选择的物品）而不是一个水桶（它要求你清空水桶）它）。毕竟，您可能不会对大英图书馆中所有未读的书籍感到不知所措，并不是因为它们的数量不多，而是因为您从未想过阅读它们可能是您的工作全部。

Coming at life this way definitely entails tough choices. But it's liberating, too, as you slowly begin to grasp that you never had any other option. There's no point beating yourself up for failing to clear a backlog (of unread books, undone tasks, unrealized dreams) that it was always inherently unfeasible to clear in the first place. I like to think of it as the productivity technique to beat all productivity techniques: finally internalizing the implications of the fact that what's genuinely impossible – the clue is in the name! – cannot actually be done.

以这种方式生活肯定需要艰难的选择。但这也是一种解放，因为你慢慢开始意识到你没有任何其他选择。没有必要因为未能清除积压的工作（未读的书、未完成的任务、未实现的梦想）而责备自己，而这些积压的工作本来就不可能清除。我喜欢将其视为击败所有生产力技术的生产力技术：最终内化真正不可能的事实的含义 - 线索就在名称中！ – 实际上无法完成。
