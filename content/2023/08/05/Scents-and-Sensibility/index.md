I started thinking about smell in 1965. At art college, a friend and I made a little collection of evocative aromas, housed in about fifty small bottles. There was rubber, naptha, motorcycle dope, cuir de russe (used to make leather smell like leather rather than dead animals), gasoline, ammonia, juniper wood. In 1978, in a neglected and unlikely part of London, I discovered an old pharmacy that was crammed with oils and absolutes.

1965 年，我开始思考气味。在艺术学院，我和一位朋友收集了一些令人回味的香气，装在大约 50 个小瓶子里。其中有橡胶、石脑油、摩托车涂料、俄罗斯皮革（用于使皮革闻起来像皮革而不是死动物的气味）、汽油、氨、杜松木。 1978 年，在伦敦一个被忽视且不太可能的地方，我发现了一家古老的药房，里面堆满了精油和净油。

Their beautiful names - styrax, patchouli, franipani, amber, myrrh, geraniol, opoponax, heliotrope - and their familiar/strange aromas attracted my curiosity, and I bought over a hundred bottles. Soon I found myself actively collecting the primary materials of perfumery - in Madrid I found a crumbling apothecary's with dozens of mysteriously labeled phials; in San Francisco I discovered the strage olfactory world of Chinatown, of five spices and jasmine and ginseng; a woman I met in Ibiza gave me a minute bottle containing just one drop of an utterly heavenly material called nardo (I later came to think that this was probably spikenard oil, extracted from a shrub growing at between six and eight thousand feet on the Himalayas and used by wealthy Indian ladies as a prelude to lovemaking).

它们美丽的名字——苏合香、广藿香、赤素馨花、琥珀、没药、香叶醇、愈伤草、天芥菜——以及它们熟悉/陌生的香气吸引了我的好奇心，我买了一百多瓶。很快，我发现自己在积极收集香水的主要材料——在马德里，我发现了一家摇摇欲坠的药店，里面有几十个贴着神秘标签的小瓶；在旧金山，我发现了唐人街的嗅觉世界，五种香料、茉莉花和人参；我在伊维萨岛遇到的一位女士给了我一瓶小瓶子，里面只有一滴名为纳尔多的天堂般的材料（后来我开始认为这可能是甘松油，从生长在喜马拉雅山六到八千英尺之间的灌木中提取）并被富有的印度女士用作做爱的前奏）。

I started mixing things together. I was fascinated by the synergies of combinations, how two quite familiar smells carefully combined could create new and unrecognizable sensation. Perfumery has a lot to do with this process of courting the edges of unrecognizability, of evoking sensations that don't have names, or of mixing up sensations that don't belong together. Some materials are in themselves schizophrenic (or is it oxymoronic?) in that they have two rather contradictory natures. Methyl octane carbonate, for example, evokes the smell of violets and motorcycles; Dior's *Farenheit* uses a lot of it. Orris butter, a complex derivative of the roots of iris, is vaguely floral in small amounts but almost obscenely fleshy (like the smell beneath a breast or between buttocks) in quantity. Civet, from the anal gland of the civet cat, is intensely disagreeable as soon as it is recognizable, but amazingly sexy in subliminal doses (it features in Guerlain's *Jicky*, probably the oldest extant perfume, and one whose market has changed over the hundred years of its existence - it now has a following among gay men). Courmarin, the primary ingredient in Cacharel's *Lou Lou*, has the characteristic smell of late summer, from whose flowers and grassses it is derived, but then it carries strange overtones of powder, boudoirs, bedrooms...

我开始把东西混合在一起。我对组合的协同作用着迷，两种非常熟悉的气味仔细组合如何能够创造出新的、无法辨认的感觉。香水与追求无法辨认的边缘、唤起无名的感觉或混合不属于一起的感觉的过程有很大关系。有些材料本身就是精神分裂的（或者是矛盾的？），因为它们具有两种相当矛盾的性质。例如，甲基辛烷碳酸酯会让人想起紫罗兰和摩托车的气味； Dior的华氏度就大量使用了它。鸢尾草黄油是鸢尾根的复杂衍生物，少量时隐隐约约带有花香，但量多时却几乎令人厌恶的肉质（就像乳房下方或臀部之间的气味）。果子狸，来自果子狸的肛门腺，一旦被认出来就让人非常不舒服，但在潜意识剂量下却令人惊讶地性感（它出现在娇兰的 Jicky 香水中，可能是现存最古老的香水，百年来市场已经发生了变化）它的存在 - 它现在在男同性恋中拥有一批追随者）。香豆素是卡夏尔 Lou Lou 的主要成分，具有夏末特有的气味，源自夏末的花草，但同时又带有粉末、闺房、卧室的奇怪暗示……

You don't have to dabble for very long to begin to realize that the world of smell has no reliable maps, no single language, no comprehensible metaphorical structure within which we might comprehend it and navigate our way around it. It seems to compare poorly, for example, with the world of sight. If we want to think about color, we can use words like hue and brightess and saturation. We can visualize a particular sightly milky green, imagine where it falls on a spectrum chart, look at its neighbours and complemetaries, and the finally say that it is, say, "eau de nil" or "pale turquoise" or "jade." These are relatively precise numerically, in angstroms, for example, or (if you want to paint your house in it) as "British Standard paintshade number something-or-other." Similarly with shape: We use measurement and geometry and, of course, drawings, to communicate that type of information.

你不需要涉足很长时间就能开始意识到气味世界没有可靠的地图，没有单一的语言，没有可理解的隐喻结构让我们可以理解它并在它周围导航。例如，与视觉世界相比，它似乎很糟糕。如果我们想考虑颜色，我们可以使用色调、亮度和饱和度等词。我们可以想象一种特殊的乳白色，想象它在光谱图上的位置，看看它的邻居和互补色，最后说它是“淡绿”或“淡绿松石”或“玉”。这些在数字上是相对精确的，例如以埃为单位，或者（如果你想用它来粉刷你的房子）“英国标准油漆色号”。形状也类似：我们使用测量和几何形状，当然还有绘图来传达此类信息。

But the best we seem to be able to do with smells is to evoke comparisons. We can say that karanal is "like striking a flint," that the aldehyde C14 is "like latex." As far as I know there is not even the beginning of a usable system of realting these to one another. Where does karanal stand in relation to tuberose? Or sandalwood to sage? Don't ask me.

但我们对气味所能做的最好的事情似乎就是引起比较。我们可以说卡拉纳尔“就像敲击打火石”，醛C14“就像乳胶”。据我所知，甚至还没有一个可用的系统来相互传递这些信息。卡拉纳尔与晚香玉的关系如何？还是檀香转鼠尾草？别问我。

Like others who've played with perfumes, I found this somewhat unsatisfactory. I wanted a system, a map. I briefly thought I might be able to make one myself, but this plan foundered as I jotted down the resemblance between strawberries and egg yolk, between breweries and certain types of horsehair bedding. I just knew I didn't have enough stamina to collect, let alone collate, all those sensations. I'd also noticed to my confusion that the substances "coriander" and "vetiver" were never quite the same twice. The vetiver I bought in the Walworth Road in London was distinctly different from what I got from the labs of Quest International in Paris, and the French coriander I found in 1988 was different from the French coriander I bought a year later. Even the names, it turned out, didn't describe anything stable. So, still lost, I abandoned the classification project (what a relief!) and decided to continue pleasurably stumbling around in the gloaming, rubbing bits of thei and that on anyone kind enough to loan me a patch of their skin, then sniffing to test the effects (it turned out to be a great way of getting to know people...).

和其他玩过香水的人一样，我觉得这有点不太令人满意。我想要一个系统，一张地图。我短暂地想过我也许可以自己做一个，但当我记下草莓和蛋黄之间、啤酒厂和某些类型的马毛床上用品之间的相似之处时，这个计划失败了。我只知道我没有足够的耐力来收集，更不用说整理所有这些感觉了。我还困惑地注意到，“香菜”和“香根草”这两个物质从来没有两次完全相同。我在伦敦沃尔沃斯路购买的香根草与我从巴黎 Quest International 实验室获得的香根草明显不同，我在 1988 年发现的法国香菜也与我一年后购买的法国香菜不同。事实证明，甚至连名字也没有描述任何稳定的东西。所以，我还是迷失了，放弃了分类项目（真是松了一口气！）并决定继续愉快地在暮色中跌跌撞撞，在任何好心借给我一块皮肤的人身上摩擦它们的碎片，然后嗅探以测试效果（事实证明这是认识人的好方法......）。

It took me a long time to begin to realize that this was the way things were likely to continue. Just like with everything else, there was probably never going to be a time when I "knew what I was doing," when I had in mind some final, logical picture of the whole world of smell. The Linnaeus of smell was not to be, or not to be me.

我花了很长时间才开始意识到事情可能会这样继续下去。就像其他事情一样，我可能永远不会“知道自己在做什么”，也不会在脑海中对整个气味世界有一个最终的、符合逻辑的画面。嗅觉的林奈不是我，也不是我。

It's strange how you arrive at ideas, how thoughts consolidate themselves out of the most disparate and unlikely beginnings, and how often those beginnings are realizations from experience that something isn't possible (or alternately is possible but not interesting). This is one such roundabout story.

奇怪的是，你如何得出想法，思想如何从最不同和最不可能的开端中整合出来，以及这些开端往往是从经验中认识到某件事是不可能的（或者是可能的，但不有趣）。这就是一个这样迂回的故事。

During my dabbling with perfumes, I'd also been dabbling with other things, including music. Whenever I talked about sound, I stressed the inadequacy of the classical languages that composers had used to describe it. I said that the evolution of the electronic instruments and recording processes had created a situation where the whole question of timbre - the physical quality of sound - had been opened up wide and had become a major focus of compositional attention. Modern composers and producers working in recording studios were experimenting with sound itself and were quite content to use largely traditional "received" forms (such as "the blues") upon which to hang their experiments. It struck me that this had been completely missed by classically trained musicologists, who were always looking for innovation in places where it wasn't happening. They were expecting that any music that deserved the title "new" would be making breakthroughs in harmony, in melody, in compositional structure; but here they were faced with a music that, in those respects, had barely made it past the turn of the century.

在涉足香水的同时，我也涉足其他事物，包括音乐。每当我谈论声音时，我都会强调作曲家用来描述声音的古典语言的不足。我说过，电子乐器和录音过程的发展创造了一种情况，即整个音色问题——声音的物理质量——已经被广泛地开放，并成为作曲关注的一个主要焦点。在录音室工作的现代作曲家和制作人正在尝试声音本身，并且非常满意地使用大部分传统的“公认”形式（例如“布鲁斯”）来进行他们的实验。让我惊讶的是，受过古典训练的音乐学家完全忽视了这一点，他们总是在没有发生的地方寻找创新。他们期待任何配得上“新”称号的音乐都必须在和声、旋律、作曲结构上有所突破；但在这里，他们面对的是一种音乐，从这些方面来说，它几乎没有熬过世纪之交。

When they failed to notice, or at least attach any importance to, was that their language, the language of classical written composition, simply didn't have any terms to describe Jimi Hendrix's guitar sound on "*Voodoo Chile*" or Phil Spector's production of "*Da Doo Ron Ron*" - arguably the most interesting features of those works. Rock music, I kept saying, was a music of timbre and texture, of the physical experience of sound, in a way that no other music had ever been or could have ever been. It dealt with a potentially infinite sonic pallette, a palette whose gradations and combinations would never adequately be described, and where the attempt at description must always lag behind the infinites of permutation.

当他们没有注意到，或者至少没有重视的是，他们的语言，古典书面作品的语言，根本没有任何术语来描述吉米·亨德里克斯在“Voodoo Chile”中的吉他声音或菲尔·斯佩克特制作的“ Da Doo Ron Ron”——可以说是这些作品中最有趣的特征。我一直说，摇滚乐是一种音色和质感的音乐，是一种声音的物理体验的音乐，其方式是其他音乐从未有过或不可能达到的。它涉及一个潜在的无限声音调色板，一个其渐变和组合永远无法充分描述的调色板，并且描述的尝试必须始终落后于无限的排列。

So while I was happy to accept and exploit this wonderfully fluid situation in music, I was worried about finding myself in the same place vis-à-vis perfume. The inconsistency of these positions finally filtered through to me while I was delivering a talk to a group of businessmen in Brussels. My talk was called "The Future of Culture in Europe," and in it I tried to sketch out the breakdown of the classical view of Culture and art history in favor of a more contemporary one. Until quite recently, I said, Culture had been viewed as a field of hurman behaviors and artifacts that could be organized in some ideal way, the assumption being that, if only we sat down and talked about it for long enough, we would all agree that, say, Dante, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Goethe, Wagner, and a few other big names were the real kingpins of Culture, and that, say, chocolate-box designers, popular balladeers, walking-stick carvers, hairdressers, clothes designers, and Little Richard were all relatively marginal. The history of the history of art is really the story of people trying to make a claim form one orthodoxy in favor of any other, asserting that the particular line that they drew through the field of all the events we refer to as Culture had some special validity and the proximity to that line was a measure of originality, profundity, longevity: in short, of value.

因此，虽然我很高兴接受并利用音乐中这种奇妙的流动情况，但我担心发现自己与香水处于同样的境地。当我在布鲁塞尔向一群商人发表演讲时，这些立场的不一致最终渗透到我身上。我的演讲名为“欧洲文化的未来”，在其中我试图勾勒出文化和艺术史的古典观点的崩溃，以支持更现代的观点。我说，直到最近，文化一直被视为人类行为和人工制品的一个领域，可以以某种理想的方式组织起来，假设是，如果我们坐下来讨论它足够长的时间，我们都会同意比如说，但丁、莎士比亚、贝多芬、歌德、瓦格纳和其他一些大人物是文化的真正支柱，比如说，巧克力盒设计师、流行民谣歌手、手杖雕刻师、理发师、服装设计师，和小理查德都是相对边缘的。艺术史的历史实际上是人们试图从一种正统观念中提出主张以支持任何另一种正统观念的故事，断言他们在我们称为文化的所有事件领域中划出的特定路线具有某些特殊性。有效性和与这条线的接近程度是衡量原创性、深度和寿命的标准：简而言之，是价值的标准。

For many reasons this idea of intrinsic, given value becomes less and less tenable. We don't expect to write books now called "The History of Painting" (as if there were only one), and only a dwindling band of fundamentalists (about 5.9 billion at the last count) still believe in "the True Nature" of anything. We become more and more comfortable with the idea that there are all sorts of ways of describing and organizing phenomena, that there are descriptive languages that don't translate into one another, that there is no absolute basis upon which to decide between one language and the other, and that anyway, "the same set of phenomena" is a shifting field of energies that we choose to give the same name to until it gets so confusing that we have to find another.

由于多种原因，这种固有的、给定价值的观念变得越来越站不住脚。我们不指望写出现在被称为“绘画史”的书（好像只有一本），只有少数原教旨主义者（最新统计约为 59 亿）仍然相信绘画的“真实本质”。任何事物。我们越来越接受这样一种观念：描述和组织现象有各种各样的方式，有一些描述性语言不能相互翻译，没有绝对的基础可以在一种语言和另一种语言之间做出决定。另一个，无论如何，“同一组现象”是一个不断变化的能量场，我们选择给它起同样的名字，直到它变得如此令人困惑，以至于我们必须找到另一个。

So, just as we might come to accept that "coriander" is a name for a fuzzy, not very clearly defined space in the whole of our smell experience, we also start to think about other words in the same way. Big Ideas (Freedom, Truth, Beauty, Love, Reality, Art, God, America, Socialism) start to lose their capital letters, cease being so absolute and reliable, and become names for spaces in our psyches. We find ourselves having to frequently reassess or even reconstruct them completely. We are, in short, increasingly uncentered, unmoored, lost, living day to day, engaged in and ongoing attempt to cobble together a credible, at least workable, set of values, ready to shed it and work out another when the situation demands.

因此，正如我们可能会接受“香菜”是我们整个嗅觉体验中一个模糊的、定义不明确的空间的名称一样，我们也开始以同样的方式思考其他词。大思想（自由、真理、美、爱、现实、艺术、上帝、美国、社会主义）开始失去大写字母，不再那么绝对和可靠，并成为我们心灵中空间的名称。我们发现自己必须经常重新评估甚至完全重建它们。简而言之，我们日复一日地生活着，越来越失去中心、失去了锚定、迷失了方向，不断地尝试着拼凑出一套可信的、至少可行的价值观，准备在情况需要时抛弃它，制定出另一套价值观。

And I love it: I love watching us all become dilettante perfume blenders, poking inquisitive fingers through a great library of ingredients and seeing which combinations make sense for us, gathering experience - the possibility of better guesses - without certainty.

我喜欢它：我喜欢看着我们都成为外行香水调配师，用好奇的手指探索一个伟大的成分库，看看哪些组合对我们有意义，收集经验 - 更好猜测的可能性 - 没有确定性。

Perhaps our sense of this, the sense of belonging to a world held together by networks of ephemeral confidences (such as philosophies and stock markets) rather than permanent certainties, predisposes us to embrace the pleasures of our most primitive and unlangued sense. Being mystified doesn't frighten us as much as it used to. And the point for me is not to expect perfumery to take its place in some nice, reliable, rational world order, but to expect everything else to become like perfume.

也许我们的这种感觉，即对一个由短暂的信心网络（例如哲学和股票市场）而不是永久的确定性所组成的世界的归属感，使我们倾向于拥抱我们最原始和无语言的感觉的乐趣。感到困惑并不像以前那样让我们感到害怕。对我来说，重点不是期望香水能够在某种美好、可靠、理性的世界秩序中占据一席之地，而是期望其他一切都变得像香水一样。
