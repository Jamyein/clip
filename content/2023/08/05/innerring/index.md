## The Inner Ring 内环

***By C. S. Lewis***

***作者：C.S.刘易斯***

May I read you a few lines from Tolstoy’s *[War and Peace](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375760644/lewissociety-20 "Visit http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375760644/lewissociety-20 (click to open in a new window)")*?

我可以给你念几句托尔斯泰的《战争与和平》吗？

When Boris entered the room, Prince Andrey was listening to an old general, wearing his decorations, who was reporting something to Prince Andrey, with an expression of soldierly servility on his purple face. “Alright. Please wait!” he said to the general, speaking in Russian with the French accent which he used when he spoke with contempt. The moment he noticed Boris he stopped listening to the general who trotted imploringly after him and begged to be heard, while Prince Andrey turned to Boris with a cheerful smile and a nod of the head. Boris now clearly understood—what he had already guessed—that side by side with the system of discipline and subordination which were laid down in the Army Regulations, there existed a different and more real system—the system which compelled a tightly laced general with a purple face to wait respectfully for his turn while a mere captain like Prince Andrey chatted with a mere second lieutenant like Boris. Boris decided at once that he would be guided not by the official system but by this other unwritten system.

当鲍里斯走进房间时，安德烈公爵正在听一位戴着勋章的老将军讲话，他正在向安德烈公爵报告一些事情，他紫色的脸上带着军人般的奴性表情。 “好吧。请稍等！”他用带着法国口音的俄语对将军说道，他说话时带着轻蔑的口音。当他注意到鲍里斯时，他不再听将军的讲话，将军在他身后小跑着，恳求他听到他的声音，而安德烈公爵则转向鲍里斯，脸上带着愉快的微笑，点了点头。鲍里斯现在清楚地明白了——他已经猜到了——除了《陆军条例》中规定的纪律和隶属制度之外，还存在着一种不同的、更真实的制度——这种制度迫使一位衣着严密的将军一个像安德烈公爵这样的上尉和一个像鲍里斯这样的少尉正在聊天。鲍里斯立即决定，他不会受官方体系的指导，而是受另一个不成文体系的指导。

When you invite a middle-aged moralist to address you, I suppose I must conclude, however unlikely the conclusion seems, that you have a taste for middle-aged moralising. I shall do my best to gratify it. I shall in fact, give you advice about the world in which you are going to live. I do not mean by this that I am going to talk on what are called current affairs. You probably know quite as much about them as I do. I am not going to tell you—except in a form so general that you will hardly recognise it—what part you ought to play in post-war reconstruction.

当你邀请一位中年道德家向你演讲时，我想我必须得出结论，无论结论看起来多么不可能，你喜欢中年道德说教。我会尽我所能去满足它。事实上，我将为你提供有关你将要生活的世界的建议。我并不是说我要谈论所谓的时事。你可能和我一样了解它们。我不会告诉你——除了以一种你几乎认不出的形式——你应该在战后重建中扮演什么角色。

It is not, in fact, very likely that any of you will be able, in the next ten years, to make any direct contribution to the peace or prosperity of Europe. You will be busy finding jobs, getting married, acquiring facts. I am going to do something more old-fashioned than you perhaps expected. I am going to give advice. I am going to issue warnings. Advice and warnings about things which are so perennial that no one calls them “current affairs.”

事实上，在未来十年里，你们中的任何人都不可能为欧洲的和平或繁荣做出任何直接贡献。你会忙于找工作、结婚、了解事实。我要做的事情可能比你想象的更老式。我将提供建议。我将发出警告。对那些长期存在以至于没有人称之为“时事”的事物的建议和警告。

And of course everyone knows what a middle-aged moralist of my type warns his juniors against. He warns them against the World, the Flesh, and the Devil. But one of this trio will be enough to deal with today. The Devil, I shall leave strictly alone. The association between him and me in the public mind has already gone quite as deep as I wish: in some quarters it has already reached the level of confusion, if not of identification. I begin to realise the truth of the old proverb that he who sups with that formidable host needs a long spoon. As for the Flesh, you must be very abnormal young people if you do not know quite as much about it as I do. But on the World I think I have something to say.

当然，每个人都知道我这种类型的中年道德家警告他的后辈要注意什么。他警告他们要提防世界、肉体和魔鬼。但今天，这三个人中的一个就足够了。魔鬼，我不会再打扰他了。我和他在公众心目中的联系已经如我所愿那样深入：在某些方面，即使还没有达到认同的程度，它也已经达到了混乱的程度。我开始意识到那句古老谚语的真理：与强大的主人共进晚餐的人需要一把长勺子。至于肉身，如果你们没有我了解得那么多，你们一定是非常变态的年轻人。但关于世界，我想我有话要说。

In the passage I have just read from Tolstoy, the young second lieutenant Boris Dubretskoi discovers that there exist in the army two different systems or hierarchies. The one is printed in some little red book and anyone can easily read it up. It also remains constant. A general is always superior to a colonel, and a colonel to a captain. The other is not printed anywhere. Nor is it even a formally organised secret society with officers and rules which you would be told after you had been admitted. You are never formally and explicitly admitted by anyone. You discover gradually, in almost indefinable ways, that it exists and that you are outside it; and then later, perhaps, that you are inside it.

在我刚刚读到的托尔斯泰的文章中，年轻的少尉鲍里斯·杜布雷茨科伊发现军队中存在着两种不同的体系或等级制度。该内容被印在一些小红书中，任何人都可以轻松阅读。它也保持不变。将军永远高于上校，上校永远高于上尉。另一个没有在任何地方打印。它甚至不是一个正式组织的秘密社团，其官员和规则是在你被录取后才会被告知的。你永远不会被任何人正式和明确地承认。你逐渐地以几乎无法定义的方式发现它的存在，而你却置身于它之外。然后，也许，你就在里面了。

There are what correspond to passwords, but they are too spontaneous and informal. A particular slang, the use of particular nicknames, an allusive manner of conversation, are the marks. But it is not so constant. It is not easy, even at a given moment, to say who is inside and who is outside. Some people are obviously in and some are obviously out, but there are always several on the borderline. And if you come back to the same Divisional Headquarters, or Brigade Headquarters, or the same regiment or even the same company, after six weeks’ absence, you may find this secondary hierarchy quite altered.

有与密码相对应的东西，但它们太自发和非正式。特定的俚语、特定昵称的使用、暗示性的谈话方式，都是标记。但它并不是那么恒定。即使在特定时刻，也很难说清楚谁在里面，谁在外面。有些人显然在里面，有些人显然在外面，但总有一些人处于边缘。而如果你在离开六周后回到同一个师部、旅部、同一个团甚至同一个连，你可能会发现这个二级层级发生了很大的变化。

There are no formal admissions or expulsions. People think they are in it after they have in fact been pushed out of it, or before they have been allowed in: this provides great amusement for those who are really inside. It has no fixed name. The only certain rule is that the insiders and outsiders call it by different names. From inside it may be designated, in simple cases, by mere enumeration: it may be called “You and Tony and me.” When it is very secure and comparatively stable in membership it calls itself “we.” When it has to be expanded to meet a particular emergency it calls itself “all the sensible people at this place.” From outside, if you have dispaired of getting into it, you call it “That gang” or “they” or “So-and-so and his set” or “The Caucus” or “The Inner Ring.” If you are a candidate for admission you probably don’t call it anything. To discuss it with the other outsiders would make you feel outside yourself. And to mention talking to the man who is inside, and who may help you if this present conversation goes well, would be madness.

没有正式的录取或开除。人们在实际上被推出去之后，或者在被允许进入之前，就认为自己身处其中：这为那些真正在里面的人提供了极大的乐趣。它没有固定的名称。唯一确定的规则是内部和外部的叫法不同。在简单的情况下，仅通过枚举就可以从内部指定它：它可以被称为“你和托尼和我”。当它的成员身份非常安全且相对稳定时，它称自己为“我们”。当它必须扩大以应对特定的紧急情况时，它称自己为“这个地方所有明智的人”。从外面看，如果你不想加入其中，你可以称其为“那个帮派”或“他们”或“某某和他的圈子”或“核心小组”或“内环”。如果你是一名入学候选人，你可能不会称呼它任何东西。与其他局外人讨论这个问题会让你感觉自己格格不入。如果提到与里面的人交谈，如果当前的谈话进展顺利，他可能会帮助你，那将是疯狂的。

Badly as I may have described it, I hope you will all have recognised the thing I am describing. Not, of course, that you have been in the Russian Army, or perhaps in any army. But you have met the phenomenon of an Inner Ring. You discovered one in your house at school before the end of the first term. And when you had climbed up to somewhere near it by the end of your second year, perhaps you discovered that within the ring there was a Ring yet more inner, which in its turn was the fringe of the great school Ring to which the house Rings were only satellites. It is even possible that the school ring was almost in touch with a Masters’ Ring. You were beginning, in fact, to pierce through the skins of an onion. And here, too, at your University—shall I be wrong in assuming that at this very moment, invisible to me, there are several rings—independent systems or concentric rings—present in this room? And I can assure you that in whatever hospital, inn of court, diocese, school, business, or college you arrive after going down, you will find the Rings—what Tolstoy calls the second or unwritten systems.

尽管我描述得可能很糟糕，但我希望你们都能认出我所描述的事情。当然，这并不是说您曾在俄罗斯军队中服役过，或者可能在任何军队中服役过。但你已经遇到过内环现象了。第一学期结束前，您在学校家里发现了一个。当你在第二学年结束时爬到它附近的某个地方时，也许你会发现在环内有一个更内部的环，而它又是学校大环的边缘，房子环向它只是卫星。甚至有可能，校环和大师环都差点接触到了。事实上，你正开始刺穿洋葱皮。在这里，同样，在你们大学——我是否会错误地假设，就在此时此刻，在我看不见的地方，有几个环——独立的系统或同心环——出现在这个房间里？我可以向你保证，无论你到达什么医院、法院、教区、学校、企业或大学，你都会找到指环——托尔斯泰称之为第二或不成文的系统。

All this is rather obvious. I wonder whether you will say the same of my next step, which is this. I believe that in all men’s lives at certain periods, and in many men’s lives at all periods between infancy and extreme old age, one of the most dominant elements is the desire to be inside the local Ring and the terror of being left outside. This desire, in one of its forms, has indeed had ample justice done to it in literature. I mean, in the form of snobbery. Victorian fiction is full of characters who are hag-ridden by the desire to get inside that particular Ring which is, or was, called Society. But it must be clearly understood that “Society,” in that sense of the word, is merely one of a hundred Rings, and snobbery therefore only one form of the longing to be inside.

这一切都是相当明显的。我不知道你是否也会对我的下一步说同样的话，就是这个。我相信，在所有男人的生命中的某些时期，以及许多男人从婴儿期到老年的所有时期的生命中，最主要的因素之一就是渴望进入当地的圈子，以及害怕被留在外面。这种欲望，以其某种形式，确实在文学中得到了充分的公正对待。我的意思是，以势利的形式。维多利亚时代的小说充满了渴望进入那个被称为“社会”的特定戒指的渴望的人物。但我们必须清楚地认识到，“社会”在这个词的意义上只是一百个环中的一个，因此势利只是渴望进入社会的一种形式。

People who believe themselves to be free, and indeed are free, from snobbery, and who read satires on snobbery with tranquil superiority, may be devoured by the desire in another form. It may be the very intensity of their desire to enter some quite different Ring which renders them immune from all the allurements of high life. An invitation from a duchess would be very cold comfort to a man smarting under the sense of exclusion from some artistic or communistic côterie. Poor man—it is not large, lighted rooms, or champagne, or even scandals about peers and Cabinet Ministers that he wants: it is the sacred little attic or studio, the heads bent together, the fog of tobacco smoke, and the delicious knowledge that we—we four or five all huddled beside this stove—are the people who know.

那些相信自己是自由的、而且确实是自由于势利的人，以及带着平静的优越感阅读讽刺势利的人，可能会被另一种形式的欲望所吞噬。也许正是他们渴望进入某个完全不同的环的强烈愿望，使他们免受上流生活的所有诱惑。对于一个因被某些艺术或共产主义小圈子排斥而痛苦不堪的男人来说，来自公爵夫人的邀请将是一种非常冰冷的安慰。可怜的人——他想要的不是宽敞、明亮的房间，也不是香槟，甚至不是同僚和内阁部长的丑闻：而是神圣的小阁楼或工作室，低着头，烟草烟雾的烟雾，以及美味的知识我们——我们四五个人都挤在这个炉子旁边——是知道的人。

Often the desire conceals itself so well that we hardly recognize the pleasures of fruition. Men tell not only their wives but themselves that it is a hardship to stay late at the office or the school on some bit of important extra work which they have been let in for because they and So-and-so and the two others are the only people left in the place who really know how things are run. But it is not quite true. It is a terrible bore, of course, when old Fatty Smithson draws you aside and whispers, “Look here, we’ve got to get you in on this examination somehow” or “Charles and I saw at once that you’ve got to be on this committee.” A terrible bore… ah, but how much more terrible if you were left out! It is tiring and unhealthy to lose your Saturday afternoons: but to have them free because you don’t matter, that is much worse.

通常，欲望隐藏得如此之好，以至于我们几乎察觉不到实现的乐趣。男人不仅告诉他们的妻子，也告诉他们自己，在办公室或学校为了一些重要的额外工作而熬夜是一件很困难的事情，因为他们和某某以及另外两个人是他们被允许做的事情。只有留在这个地方的人真正知道事情是如何运作的。但这并不完全正确。当然，当老胖子史密森把你拉到一边低声说：“看这里，我们必须以某种方式让你参加这次考试”或者“查尔斯和我立刻意识到你必须成为这个委员会的成员。”真是令人厌烦……啊，但如果你被排除在外，那该多可怕啊！失去周六的下午是很累人的，也是不健康的：但是因为你不重要而让它们自由，那就更糟糕了。

Freud would say, no doubt, that the whole thing is a subterfuge of the sexual impulse. I wonder whether the shoe is not sometimes on the other foot. I wonder whether, in ages of promiscuity, many a virginity has not been lost less in obedience to Venus than in obedience to the lure of the caucus. For of course, when promiscuity is the fashion, the chaste are outsiders. They are ignorant of something that other people know. They are uninitiated. And as for lighter matters, the number of people who first smoked or first got drunk for a similar reason is probably very large.

毫无疑问，弗洛伊德会说，整件事都是性冲动的诡计。我想知道鞋子是否有时不在另一只脚上。我想知道，在乱交的时代，许多人是否因为服从金星而失去童贞，而不是因为服从党团的诱惑而失去童贞。当然，当乱交成为时尚时，贞洁的人就成了局外人。他们对别人知道的事情一无所知。他们是无知的。至于较轻的事情，因为类似原因第一次抽烟或第一次喝醉的人数可能非常多。

I must now make a distinction. I am not going to say that the existence of Inner Rings is an Evil. It is certainly unavoidable. There must be confidential discussions: and it is not only a bad thing, it is (in itself) a good thing, that personal friendship should grow up between those who work together. And it is perhaps impossible that the official hierarchy of any organisation should coincide with its actual workings. If the wisest and most energetic people held the highest spots, it might coincide; since they often do not, there must be people in high positions who are really deadweights and people in lower positions who are more important than their rank and seniority would lead you to suppose. It is necessary: and perhaps it is not a necessary evil. But the desire which draws us into Inner Rings is another matter. A thing may be morally neutral and yet the desire for that thing may be dangerous. As Byron has said:

我现在必须做出区分。我不会说内环的存在是邪恶的。这当然是不可避免的。必须进行秘密讨论：一起工作的人之间应该发展个人友谊，这不仅是一件坏事，而且（本身）是一件好事。任何组织的官方等级制度都不可能与其实际运作相一致。如果最聪明、最有活力的人占据最高的位置，这可能是巧合；因为他们往往不这样做，所以一定有一些身居高位的人确实是无足轻重的人，而一些身居低位的人比他们的级别和资历更重要。这是必要的：也许这并不是一种必要的罪恶。但吸引我们进入内环的欲望则是另一回事。某件事可能在道德上是中立的，但对该事物的渴望可能是危险的。正如拜伦所说：

-   Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
    
    甜蜜是一种遗产，而甜蜜又会过去

-   The unexpected death of some old lady
    
    一位老太太的意外死亡

The painless death of a pious relative at an advanced age is not an evil. But an earnest desire for her death on the part of her heirs is not reckoned a proper feeling, and the law frowns on even the gentlest attempts to expedite her departure. Let Inner Rings be unavoidable and even an innocent feature of life, though certainly not a beautiful one: but what of our longing to enter them, our anguish when we are excluded, and the kind of pleasure we feel when we get in?

一位虔诚的亲戚在高龄时无痛苦地去世并不是一件坏事。但她的继承人对她死亡的热切愿望并不被认为是一种适当的感觉，而且法律也会反对即使是最温和的加速她离开的尝试。让内环成为不可避免的，甚至是生活中的一个天真的特征，尽管肯定不是一个美丽的特征：但是我们对进入内环的渴望，当我们被排除时的痛苦，以及当我们进入时我们感受到的那种快乐又如何呢？

I have no right to make assumptions about the degree to which any of you may already be compromised. I must not assume that you have ever first neglected, and finally shaken off, friends whom you really loved and who might have lasted you a lifetime, in order to court the friendship of those who appeared to you more important, more esoteric. I must not ask whether you have derived actual pleasure from the loneliness and humiliation of the outsiders after you, yourself were in: whether you have talked to fellow members of the Ring in the presence of outsiders simply in order that the outsiders might envy; whether the means whereby, in your days of probation, you propitiated the Inner Ring, were always wholly admirable. I will ask only one question—and it is, of course, a rhetorical question which expects no answer. IN the whole of your life as you now remember it, has the desire to be on the right side of that invisible line ever prompted you to any act or word on which, in the cold small hours of a wakeful night, you can look back with satisfaction? If so, your case is more fortunate than most.

我无权对你们中任何人可能已经受到损害的程度做出假设。我绝不能认为你曾经为了追求那些在你看来更重要、更深奥的人的友谊而首先忽视并最终摆脱了那些你真正爱过的、可能陪伴你一生的朋友。我不能问，在你自己加入之后，你是否从外人的孤独和屈辱中获得了真正的快乐：你是否在外人面前与环里的其他成员交谈只是为了让外人嫉妒；你是否只是为了让外人嫉妒而在外人面前与其他成员交谈？在你受缓刑的日子里，你为安抚内环而采取的手段是否总是令人完全钦佩。我只会问一个问题——当然，这是一个不期望得到答案的反问句。正如你现在所记得的那样，在你的一生中，你渴望站在那条看不见的界线的右侧，它曾经促使你做出任何行为或言语，在寒冷的夜晚，你可以回顾这些行为或言语。满意吗？如果是这样，你的情况比大多数人都要幸运。

My main purpose in this address is simply to convince you that this desire is one of the great permanent mainsprings of human action. It is one of the factors which go to make up the world as we know it—this whole pell-mell of struggle, competition, confusion, graft, disappointment and advertisement, and if it is one of the permanent mainsprings then you may be quite sure of this. Unless you take measures to prevent it, this desire is going to be one of the chief motives of your life, from the first day on which you enter your profession until the day when you are too old to care. That will be the natural thing—the life that will come to you of its own accord. Any other kind of life, if you lead it, will be the result of conscious and continuous effort. If you do nothing about it, if you drift with the stream, you will in fact be an “inner ringer.” I don’t say you’ll be a successful one; that’s as may be. But whether by pining and moping outside Rings that you can never enter, or by passing triumphantly further and further in—one way or the other you will be that kind of man.

我在这次演讲中的主要目的只是让你们相信，这种愿望是人类行动的伟大而永久的主要动力之一。它是构成我们所知道的世界的因素之一——斗争、竞争、混乱、贪污、失望和广告的整个混乱，如果它是永久的主要动力之一，那么你可能会很高兴。确信这一点。除非你采取措施阻止它，否则这种愿望将成为你一生的主要动机之一，从你进入职业的第一天到你老得不再关心的那一天。那将是很自然的事情——生命会自动来到你身边。任何其他类型的生活，如果你过它的话，都将是有意识和持续努力的结果。如果你不采取任何行动，如果你随波逐流，你实际上就是一个“内环”。我并不是说你会成为一个成功的人；我只是说你会成为一个成功的人。可能是这样。但无论是在你永远无法进入的环外憔悴、闷闷不乐，还是胜利地越走越远——不管怎样，你都会成为那样的人。

I have already made it fairly clear that I think it better for you not to be that kind of man. But you may have an open mind on the question. I will therefore suggest two reasons for thinking as I do. It would be polite and charitable, and in view of your age reasonable too, to suppose that none of you is yet a scoundrel. On the other hand, by the mere law of averages (I am saying nothing against free will) it is almost certain that at least two or three of you before you die will have become something very like scoundrels. There must be in this room the makings of at least that number of unscrupulous, treacherous, ruthless egotists. The choice is still before you: and I hope you will not take my hard words about your possible future characters as a token of disrespect to your present characters.

我已经说得很清楚了，我认为你最好不要成为那样的人。但您可能对这个问题持开放态度。因此，我将提出两个我这样思考的理由。出于礼貌和仁慈，考虑到你们的年龄，假设你们都还不是恶棍，这也是有道理的。另一方面，仅仅根据平均法则（我并不是说违背自由意志的话），几乎可以肯定，你们中至少有两三个人在死前会变成非常像恶棍的人。这个房间里肯定至少有那么多肆无忌惮、背信弃义、冷酷无情的利己主义者。选择还在你面前：我希望你不要把我对你未来可能的角色的严厉言论视为对你现在的角色的不尊重。

And the prophecy I make is this. To nine out of ten of you the choice which could lead to scoundrelism will come, when it does come, in no very dramatic colours. Obviously bad men, obviously threatening or bribing, will almost certainly not appear. Over a drink, or a cup of coffee, disguised as triviality and sandwiched between two jokes, from the lips of a man, or woman, whom you have recently been getting to know rather better and whom you hope to know better still—just at the moment when you are most anxious not to appear crude, or naïf or a prig—the hint will come. It will be the hint of something which the public, the ignorant, romantic public, would never understand: something which even the outsiders in your own profession are apt to make a fuss about: but something, says your new friend, which “we”—and at the word “we” you try not to blush for mere pleasure—something “we always do.”

我做出的预言是这样的。对于十分之九的人来说，可能导致恶棍行为的选择将会到来，当它真的到来时，不会有什么戏剧性的色彩。明显的坏人，明显的威胁或贿赂，几乎肯定不会出现。喝一杯或一杯咖啡时，伪装成琐碎的事情，夹在两个笑话中，出自一个男人或女人的嘴，你最近对他们有了更多的了解，并且你希望进一步了解他们——就在当你最不想显得粗鲁、天真或一本正经的时候，暗示就会出现。这将是公众、无知、浪漫的公众永远无法理解的暗示：即使是你所在行业的局外人也容易对此大惊小怪的事情：但是，你的新朋友说，“我们” ——说到“我们”这个词，你尽量不要仅仅因为快乐而脸红——“我们总是这样做”。

And you will be drawn in, if you are drawn in, not by desire for gain or ease, but simply because at that moment, when the cup was so near your lips, you cannot bear to be thrust back again into the cold outer world. It would be so terrible to see the other man’s face—that genial, confidential, delightfully sophisticated face—turn suddenly cold and contemptuous, to know that you had been tried for the Inner Ring and rejected. And then, if you are drawn in, next week it will be something a little further from the rules, and next year something further still, but all in the jolliest, friendliest spirit. It may end in a crash, a scandal, and penal servitude; it may end in millions, a peerage and giving the prizes at your old school. But you will be a scoundrel.

而你也会被吸引，如果你被吸引，不是因为贪图利益或安逸，而是因为那一刻，当杯子如此靠近你的嘴唇时，你无法忍受再次被推回冰冷的外部世界。看到对方的脸——那张和蔼、保密、令人愉快的老练的脸——突然变得冷漠和轻蔑，知道你已经参加了内环的面试并被拒绝了，那真是太可怕了。然后，如果你被吸引了，下周将会有一些远离规则的事情，明年会更进一步，但一切都是以最快乐、最友好的精神进行的。它可能以崩溃、丑闻和劳役告终；最终可能会获得数百万美元、爵位并在你原来的学校颁发奖品。但你会成为一个恶棍。

That is my first reason. Of all the passions, the passion for the Inner Ring is most skillful in making a man who is not yet a very bad man do very bad things. My second reason is this. The torture allotted to the Danaids in the classical underworld, that of attempting to fill sieves with water, is the symbol not of one vice, but of all vices. It is the very mark of a perverse desire that it seeks what is not to be had. The desire to be inside the invisible line illustrates this rule. As long as you are governed by that desire you will never get what you want. You are trying to peel an onion: if you succeed there will be nothing left. Until you conquer the fear of being an outsider, an outsider you will remain.

这是我的第一个原因。在所有的激情中，对内环的激情最有技巧地让一个还不是很坏的人做出很坏的事情。我的第二个原因是这样的。在古典地下世界中，丹奈德斯遭受的酷刑，即试图将筛子装满水，并不是一种罪恶的象征，而是所有罪恶的象征。追求不该拥有的东西，正是不正当欲望的标志。渴望进入看不见的线内部就说明了这一规则。只要你被这种欲望所控制，你就永远不会得到你想要的东西。你正试图剥洋葱：如果你成功了，就什么也没有剩下了。除非你克服了作为局外人的恐惧，否则你仍将是一个局外人。

This is surely very clear when you come to think of it. If you want to be made free of a certain circle for some wholesome reason—if, say, you want to join a musical society because you really like music—then there is a possibility of satisfaction. You may find yourself playing in a quartet and you may enjoy it. But if all you want is to be in the know, your pleasure will be short lived. The circle cannot have from within the charm it had from outside. By the very act of admitting you it has lost its magic.

当你想一想时，这一点肯定是非常清楚的。如果你出于某种有益的原因想要摆脱某个圈子——比如说，如果你因为真的喜欢音乐而想加入一个音乐社团——那么就有可能获得满足。您可能会发现自己在四重奏中演奏，并且您可能会喜欢它。但如果你只想了解情况，那么你的快乐将是短暂的。这个圈子不可能从内部获得它从外部获得的魅力。一旦承认你的存在，它就失去了魔力。

Once the first novelty is worn off, the members of this circle will be no more interesting than your old friends. Why should they be? You were not looking for virtue or kindness or loyalty or humour or learning or wit or any of the things that can really be enjoyed. You merely wanted to be “in.” And that is a pleasure that cannot last. As soon as your new associates have been staled to you by custom, you will be looking for another Ring. The rainbow’s end will still be ahead of you. The old ring will now be only the drab background for your endeavor to enter the new one.

一旦最初的新鲜感褪去，这个圈子里的成员就不会比你的老朋友更有趣了。为什么他们应该这样？你并不是在寻找美德、善良、忠诚、幽默、学识、智慧或任何真正可以享受的东西。你只是想“参与其中”。这是一种无法持续的快乐。一旦你的新同事习惯性地对你感到厌烦，你就会开始寻找另一枚戒指。彩虹的尽头仍然在前方。旧的戒指现在将只是你努力进入新戒指的单调背景。

And you will always find them hard to enter, for a reason you very well know. You yourself, once you are in, want to make it hard for the next entrant, just as those who are already in made it hard for you. Naturally. In any wholesome group of people which holds together for a good purpose, the exclusions are in a sense accidental. Three or four people who are together for the sake of some piece of work exclude others because there is work only for so many or because the others can’t in fact do it. Your little musical group limits its numbers because the rooms they meet in are only so big. But your genuine Inner Ring exists for exclusion. There’d be no fun if there were no outsiders. The invisible line would have no meaning unless most people were on the wrong side of it. Exclusion is no accident; it is the essence.

而且你总是会发现它们很难进入，原因你很清楚。一旦你进入，你自己就会想让下一个进入者为难，就像那些已经进入的人为你制造困难一样。自然。在任何为了美好目标而团结在一起的健康群体中，排除在某种意义上都是偶然的。三四个人为了某项工作而聚集在一起，会排斥其他人，因为工作只适合这么多人，或者因为其他人实际上无法完成。你的小音乐团体限制了人数，因为他们见面的房间就这么大。但真正的内环存在是为了排除。如果没有外人，那就没有乐趣了。除非大多数人都站在错误的一边，否则这条看不见的界线就没有意义。被排除并非偶然；这是本质。

The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain.

内环的探索会让你心碎，除非你打破了它。但如果你打破了它，就会出现令人惊讶的结果。如果你在工作时间里把工作当作你的目的，你很快就会发现自己不知不觉地陷入了你职业中唯一真正重要的圈子里。您将成为声音工匠之一，其他声音工匠也会知道这一点。这群工匠绝不会与内环、重要人物、知情人重合。它不会塑造职业政策，也不会增强职业影响力，从而为整个职业对抗公众：也不会导致内环产生的那些周期性丑闻和危机。但它会做该职业存在的那些事情，并且从长远来看，它将对该职业实际上享有的所有尊重负责，而这是演讲和广告无法维持的。

And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are indeed snug and safe at the centre of something which, seen from without, would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that the secrecy is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it.

如果在闲暇时你只是和你喜欢的人交往，你会再次发现你已经不知不觉地进入了真正的内心：你确实在某个东西的中心，从外面看，看起来完全是舒适和安全的。就像内环一样。但不同的是，这种保密是偶然的，它的排他性是一种副产品，没有人被深奥的诱惑所吸引：因为只有四五个人喜欢彼此聚会做他们喜欢的事情。这就是友谊。亚里士多德将其列为美德之一。它可能带来了世界上一半的幸福，任何一个内环都无法拥有它。

We are told in Scripture that those who ask get. That is true, in senses I can’t now explore. But in another sense there is much truth in the schoolboy’s principle “them as asks shan’t have.” To a young person, just entering on adult life, the world seems full of “insides,” full of delightful intimacies and confidentialities, and he desires to enter them. But if he follows that desire he will reach no “inside” that is worth reaching. The true road lies in quite another direction. It is like the house in [Alice Through the Looking Glass.](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1858943299//lewissociety-20 "Visit https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1858943299//lewissociety-20 (click to open in a new window)")

圣经告诉我们，凡祈求的，都会得到。确实如此，但从某种意义上来说我现在无法探索。但从另一种意义上来说，小学生的“有求必应”的原则也有很多道理。对于一个刚刚进入成人生活的年轻人来说，这个世界似乎充满了“内部”，充满了令人愉快的亲密和秘密，他渴望进入其中。但如果他追随这个愿望，他就不会到达任何值得到达的“内部”。真正的道路在另一个方向。就像爱丽丝镜中奇遇记里的房子一样。
