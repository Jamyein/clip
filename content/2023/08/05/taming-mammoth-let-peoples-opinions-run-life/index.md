**Part 1: Meet Your Mammoth**

**第 1 部分：认识你的猛犸象**

The first day I was in second grade, I came to school and noticed that there was a new, very pretty girl in the class—someone who hadn’t been there the previous two years. Her name was Alana and within an hour, she was everything to me.

我上二年级的第一天，我来到学校，发现班上新来了一个非常漂亮的女孩——她是前两年没有来过的。她的名字叫阿拉娜，不到一个小时，她就成了我的一切。

When you’re seven, there aren’t really any actionable steps you can take when you’re in love with someone. You’re not even sure what you want from the situation. There’s just this amorphous yearning that’s a part of your life, and that’s that.

当你七岁的时候，当你爱上某人时，你实际上没有任何可以采取的可行步骤。你甚至不确定自己想从这种情况中得到什么。这种无形的渴望是你生活的一部分，仅此而已。

But for me, it became suddenly relevant a few months later, when during recess one day, one of the girls in the class started asking each of the boys, “Who do *youuu* want to marry?” When she asked me, it was a no-brainer. “Alana.”

但对我来说，几个月后，它突然变得重要起来，有一天课间休息时，班上的一个女孩开始问每个男孩：“你想嫁给谁？”当她问我的时候，我觉得这是理所当然的。 “阿拉娜。”

Disaster.

I was still new to being a human and didn’t realize that the *only* socially acceptable answer was, *“No one.”*

我对做人还很陌生，并没有意识到唯一被社会接受的答案是“没有人”。

The second I answered, the heinous girl ran toward other students, telling each one, “Tim said he wants to marry *Alana!*” Each person she told covered their mouth with uncontrollable laughter. I was finished. Life was over.

我一回答，那个可恶的女孩就跑向其他学生，告诉每个学生：“蒂姆说他想娶阿拉娜！”她告诉的每个人都捂住了嘴，无法控制地大笑。我完了。生命结束了。

The news quickly got back to Alana herself, who stayed as far away from me as possible for days after. If she knew what a restraining order was, she’d have taken one out.

这个消息很快就传到了阿拉娜本人那里，几天后她都尽可能远离我。如果她知道什么是限制令，她就会取消一项。

This horrifying experience taught me a critical life lesson—it can be mortally dangerous to be yourself, and you should exercise extreme social caution at all times.

这次可怕的经历给我上了重要的人生一课——做你自己可能是致命的危险，你应该在任何时候都保持极端的社交谨慎。

Now this sounds like something only a traumatized second grader would think, but the weird thing, and the topic of this post, is that this lesson isn’t just limited to me and my debacle of a childhood—*it’s a defining paranoia of the human species.* We share a collective insanity that pervades human cultures throughout the world:

现在，这听起来像是只有受过创伤的二年级学生才会想的事情，但奇怪的是，也是这篇文章的主题，这堂课不仅限于我和我童年的崩溃——这是人类的一种定义性偏执。物种。我们都有一种普遍存在于全世界人类文化中的集体疯狂：

**An irrational and unproductive obsession with what other people think of us.**

**对别人对我们的看法的非理性和无益的痴迷。**

Evolution does everything for a reason, and to understand the origin of this particular insanity, let’s back up for a minute to 50,000BC in Ethiopia, where your [Great<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> Grandfather](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/your-ancestor-is-jellyfish.html) lived as part of a small tribe.

进化所做的一切都是有原因的，为了了解这种特殊疯狂的起源，让我们回溯到公元前 50,000 年的埃塞俄比亚，你的曾 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> 祖父作为一个小部落的一部分生活在那里。

Back then, being part of a tribe was critical to survival. A tribe meant food and protection in a time when neither was easy to come by. So for your Great<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> Grandfather, almost nothing in the world was more important than being accepted by his fellow tribe members, especially those in positions of authority. Fitting in with those around him and pleasing those above him meant he could stay in the tribe, and about the worst nightmare he could imagine would be people in the tribe starting to whisper about how annoying or unproductive or weird he was—because if enough people disapproved of him, his ranking within the tribe would drop, and if it got really bad, he’d be kicked out altogether and left for dead. He also knew that if he ever embarrassed himself by pursuing a girl in the tribe and being rejected, she’d tell the other girls about it—not only would he have blown his chance with that girl, but he might never have a mate at all now because every girl that would ever be in his life knew about his lame, failed attempt. Being socially accepted was *everything*.

那时，成为部落的一部分对于生存至关重要。在那个时代，食物和保护都不容易获得，部落意味着食物和保护。因此，对于您的曾 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> 祖父来说，世界上几乎没有什么比被他的部落成员（尤其是那些处于权威地位的成员）接受更重要的了。与周围的人融为一体并取悦上级意味着他可以留在部落，而他能想象到的最糟糕的噩梦就是部落中的人们开始窃窃私语说他是多么烦人、效率低下或奇怪——因为如果有足够多的人不赞成他，他在部落中的排名就会下降，如果情况严重的话，他就会被彻底赶出去，然后被扔去等死。他也知道，如果他曾经因为追求部落里的一个女孩而被拒绝而让自己难堪，她就会告诉其他女孩这件事——他不仅会失去与那个女孩的机会，而且他可能永远不会有伴侣。现在这一切都是因为他生命中的每一个女孩都知道他蹩脚、失败的尝试。被社会接受就是一切。

Because of this, humans evolved an over-the-top obsession with what others thought of them—a craving for social approval and admiration, and a paralyzing fear of being disliked. Let’s call that obsession a human’s Social Survival Mammoth. It looks something like this:

正因为如此，人类进化出了一种过度痴迷于他人对自己的看法——渴望社会认可和钦佩，以及对被讨厌的恐惧。让我们把这种痴迷称为人类的社会生存猛犸象。它看起来像这样：

[![Mammoth](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png)

Your Great<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> Grandfather’s Social Survival Mammoth was central to his ability to endure and thrive. It was simple—keep the mammoth well fed with social approval and pay close attention to its overwhelming fears of nonacceptance, and you’ll be fine.

你曾 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="41b18fa9-83c4-4e07-9165-6dd76fa96539">2,000</sup> 祖父的社会生存猛犸象是他忍耐和茁壮成长的能力的核心。这很简单——让猛犸象得到社会认可，并密切关注它对不接受的强烈恐惧，你就会没事的。

And that was all well and fine in 50,000BC. And 30,000BC. And 10,000BC. But something funny has happened for humans in the last 10,000 years—their civilization has *dramatically* changed. Sudden, quick change is something civilization has the ability to do, and the reason that can be awkward is that our evolutionary biology can’t move nearly as fast. So while for most of history, both our social structure and our biology evolved and adjusted at a snail’s pace together, civilization has recently developed the speed capabilities of a hare while our biology has continued snailing along.

在公元前五万年，这一切都很好。公元前三万年。公元前一万年。但在过去的一万年里，人类发生了一些有趣的事情——他们的文明发生了巨大的变化。突然、快速的变化是文明有能力做到的事情，而令人尴尬的原因是我们的进化生物学无法移动得那么快。因此，虽然在历史的大部分时间里，我们的社会结构和我们的生物学都以蜗牛般的速度共同进化和调整，但文明最近已经发展出了野兔的速度能力，而我们的生物学却继续缓慢前进。

Our bodies and minds are built to live in a tribe in 50,000BC, which leaves modern humans with a number of unfortunate traits, one of which is a fixation with tribal-style social survival in a world where social survival is no longer a real concept. We’re all here in 2014, accompanied by a large, hungry, and easily freaked-out woolly mammoth who still thinks it’s 50,000BC.

我们的身体和思想是为了生活在公元前 5 万年的部落而生的，这给现代人类留下了许多不幸的特征，其中之一就是在一个社会生存不再是一个真正概念的世界中，对部落式社会生存的执着。 2014 年，我们都来到这里，身边有一只巨大、饥饿且容易受惊的猛犸象，它仍然认为现在是公元前 5 万年。

Why else would you try on four outfits and still not be sure what to wear before going out?

不然为什么你会试穿四件衣服，出门前仍然不知道该穿什么？

The mammoth’s nightmares about romantic rejection made your ancestors cautious and savvy, but in today’s world, it just makes you a coward:

猛犸象关于浪漫拒绝的噩梦让你的祖先变得谨慎而精明，但在当今世界，这只会让你成为一个懦夫：

And don’t even get the mammoth started on the terror of artistic risks:

甚至不要让猛犸象开始对艺术风险的恐惧：

[![Karaoke](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/singing-1-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/singing-1.png)

[![singing 2](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/singing-21-1024x819.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/singing-21.png)

The mammoth’s hurricane of fear of social disapproval plays a factor in most parts of most people’s lives. It’s what makes you feel weird about going to a restaurant or a movie alone; it’s what makes parents care a little *too* much about where their child goes to college; it’s what makes you pass up a career you’d love in favor of a more lucrative career you’re lukewarm about; it’s what makes you get married before you’re ready to a person you’re not in love with.

猛犸象对社会不认可的恐惧是大多数人生活中的一个因素。这就是让你觉得独自去餐馆或看电影很奇怪的原因；这就是为什么父母过于关心孩子上哪所大学的原因；它会让你放弃你喜欢的职业，转而选择你不冷不热的更赚钱的职业；这就是让你在准备好与一个你不爱的人之前就结婚的原因。

And while keeping your highly insecure Social Survival Mammoth feeling calm and safe takes a lot of work, that’s only one half of your responsibilities. The mammoth also needs to be fed regularly and robustly—with praise, approval, and the feeling of being on the right side of any social or moral dichotomy.

虽然让你高度缺乏安全感的社会生存猛犸象感到平静和安全需要做很多工作，但这只是你责任的一半。猛犸象还需要定期、有力的喂养——给予赞扬、认可，以及在任何社会或道德二分法中站在正确一边的感觉。

Why else would you be such an [image-crafting douchebag](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/07/7-ways-to-be-insufferable-on-facebook.html) on Facebook?

不然你为什么会在 Facebook 上成为这样一个形象塑造的混蛋呢？

Or brag when you’re out with friends even though you always regret it later?

或者当你和朋友出去的时候吹牛，尽管事后你总是后悔？

[![Brag](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/brag-700x1024.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/brag.png)

Society has evolved to accommodate this mammoth-feeding frenzy, inventing things like accolades and titles and the concept of prestige in order to keep our mammoths satisfied—and often to incentivize people to do meaningless jobs and live unfulfilling lives they wouldn’t otherwise consider taking part in.

社会已经发展到适应这种猛犸象喂养的狂热，发明了诸如荣誉、头衔和声望的概念，以使我们的猛犸象满意，并且常常激励人们做无意义的工作，过他们本来不会考虑过的不充实的生活。参与.

Above all, mammoths want to fit in—that’s what tribespeople had always needed to do so that’s how they’re programmed. Mammoths look around at society to figure out what they’re supposed to do, and when it becomes clear, they jump right in. Just look at any two college fraternity pictures taken ten years apart:

最重要的是，猛犸象想要融入部落——这就是部落居民一直需要做的事情，所以它们就是这样被编程的。猛犸象环顾社会，弄清楚它们应该做什么，当事情变得清晰时，它们就会立即投入其中。只要看看任意两张相隔十年的大学兄弟会照片即可：

Or all those subcultures where *every single person* has one of the same three socially-acceptable advanced degrees:

或者在所有这些亚文化中，每个人都拥有相同的三个社会可接受的高级学位之一：

Sometimes, a mammoth’s focus isn’t on wider society as much as it’s on winning the approval of a Puppet Master in your life. A Puppet Master is a person or group of people whose opinion matters *so* much to you that they’re essentially running your life. A Puppet Master is often a parent, or maybe your significant other, or sometimes an alpha member of your group of friends. A Puppet Master can be a person you look up to who you don’t know very well—maybe even a celebrity you’ve never met—or a group of people you hold in especially high regard.

有时，猛犸象的关注点并不是更广泛的社会，而是赢得你生活中傀儡师的认可。傀儡大师是一个人或一群人，他们的意见对你来说非常重要，以至于他们实质上控制着你的生活。傀儡大师通常是父母，或者可能是您的另一半，或者有时是您朋友圈中的阿尔法成员。傀儡师可以是一个你尊敬但不太了解的人——甚至可能是一个你从未见过的名人——或者是一群你特别尊敬的人。

We crave the Puppet Master’s approval more than anyone’s, and we’re so horrified at the thought of upsetting the Puppet Master or feeling their nonacceptance or ridicule that we’ll do anything to avoid it. When we get to this toxic state in our relationship with a Puppet Master, that person’s presence hangs over our entire decision-making process and pulls the strings of our opinions and our moral voice.

我们比任何人都更渴望得到傀儡师的认可，一想到要惹恼傀儡师或者感受到他们的不接受或嘲笑，我们就感到非常恐惧，所以我们会尽一切努力来避免这种情况。当我们与傀儡师的关系达到这种有毒状态时，那个人的存在就会笼罩在我们的整个决策过程中，并影响我们的观点和道德声音。

[![puppet master](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/puppet-master-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/puppet-master.png)

With so much thought and energy dedicated to the mammoth’s needs, you often end up neglecting someone else in your brain, someone all the way at the center—your Authentic Voice.

当你把这么多的思想和精力投入到猛犸象的需求上时，你常常最终忽视了你大脑中的其他人，一个一直处于中心的人——你的真实声音。

[![AV](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AV-1024x623.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AV.png)

Your Authentic Voice, somewhere in there, knows all about you. In contrast to the black-and-white simplicity of the Social Survival Mammoth, your Authentic Voice is complex, sometimes hazy, constantly evolving, and unafraid. Your AV has its own, nuanced moral code, formed by experience, reflection, and its own personal take on compassion and integrity. It knows how you feel deep down about things like money and family and marriage, and it knows which kinds of people, topics of interest, and types of activities you truly enjoy, and which you don’t. Your AV knows that it *doesn’t* know how your life will or should play out, but it tends to have a strong hunch about the right step to take next.

你真实的声音就在其中的某个地方，了解你的一切。与社会生存猛犸象的黑白简单相比，你的真实声音是复杂的，有时是模糊的，不断发展的，并且无所畏惧。你的 AV 有自己的、细致入微的道德准则，由经验、反思以及自己对同情心和正直的个人看法形成。它知道你内心深处对金钱、家庭和婚姻等事情的感受，它知道你真正喜欢哪些人、感兴趣的话题和活动类型，哪些不喜欢。你的 AV 知道它不知道你的生活将如何或应该如何发展，但它往往对下一步要采取的正确步骤有强烈的预感。

And while the mammoth looks only to the outside world in its decision-making process, your Authentic Voice uses the outside world to learn and gather information, but when it’s time for a decision, it has all the tools it needs right there in the core of your brain.

虽然猛犸象在决策过程中只关注外部世界，但您的真实声音会利用外部世界来学习和收集信息，但当需要做出决策时，它的核心拥有所需的所有工具你的大脑。

Your AV is also someone the mammoth tends to ignore entirely. A strong opinion from a confident person in the outside world? The mammoth is all ears. But a passionate plea from your AV is largely dismissed until someone else validates it.

你的 AV 也是猛犸象往往会完全忽视的人。来自外界一个自信的人的强烈意见？猛犸象竖起了耳朵。但是，在其他人验证之前，您的 AV 的热情恳求基本上都会被驳回。

And since our 50,000-year-old brains are wired to give the mammoth a whole lot of sway in things, your Authentic Voice starts to feel like it’s irrelevant. Which makes it shrink and fade and lose motivation.

由于我们五万年前的大脑已经赋予了猛犸象很大的影响力，你的真实声音开始变得无关紧要。这使它萎缩、褪色并失去动力。

[![AV](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AV-small-1024x623.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AV-small.png)

Eventually, a mammoth-run person can lose touch with their AV entirely.

最终，一个猛犸象奔跑的人可能会与他们的自动驾驶完全失去联系。

In tribal times, AVs often spent their lives in quiet obscurity, and this was largely okay. Life was simple, and conformity was the goal—and the mammoth had conformity covered just fine.

在部落时代，自动驾驶汽车常常默默无闻地度过一生，这在很大程度上是可以接受的。生活很简单，顺从就是目标——而猛犸象很好地掩盖了顺从。

But in today’s large, complex world of varying cultures and personalities and opportunities and options, losing touch with your AV is dangerous. When you don’t know who you are, the only decision-making mechanism you’re left with is the crude and outdated needs and emotions of your mammoth. When it comes to the most personal questions, instead of digging deep into the foggy center of what you really believe in to find clarity, you’ll look to others for the answers. Who you are becomes some blend of the strongest opinions around you.

但在当今这个庞大而复杂的世界中，文化、个性、机会和选择各不相同，失去与 AV 的联系是很危险的。当你不知道自己是谁时，你唯一的决策机制就是你的猛犸象的原始和过时的需求和情感。当涉及到最私人的问题时，你不会深入挖掘你真正相信的事物的模糊中心来寻找答案，而是会向别人寻求答案。你是谁，融合了你周围最强烈的观点。

Losing touch with your AV also makes you fragile, because when your identity is built on the approval of others, being criticized or rejected by others *really* hurts. A bad break-up is painful for everyone, but it stings in a much deeper place for a mammoth-run person than for a person with a strong AV. A strong AV makes a stable core, and after a break-up, that core is still holding firm—but since the acceptance of others is all a mammoth-run person has, being dumped by a person who knows you well is a far more shattering experience.

与你的 AV 失去联系也会让你变得脆弱，因为当你的身份建立在别人的认可之上时，被别人批评或拒绝真的很痛苦。一次糟糕的分手对每个人来说都是痛苦的，但对于一个猛犸象般的人来说，它的刺痛感比对于一个拥有强大AV的人来说更深。强大的AV会形成稳定的核心，在分手后，这个核心仍然坚挺——但由于别人的接受是一个庞大的人所拥有的一切，所以被一个很了解你的人抛弃是一个更痛苦的事情。破碎的经历。

Likewise, you know those people who react to being criticized by coming back with a nasty low-blow? Those tend to be severely mammoth-run people, and criticism makes them so mad because mammoths cannot handle criticism.

同样，你知道那些在受到批评后会以令人讨厌的低骂来回应的人吗？这些人往往是猛犸象控制的人，批评让他们如此愤怒，因为猛犸象无法承受批评。

[![Low Blow](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/low-blow-1-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/low-blow-1.png)

At this point, the mission should be clear—we need to figure out a way to override the wiring of our brain and tame the mammoth. That’s the only way to take our lives back.

此时，任务应该很明确了——我们需要找到一种方法来超越我们大脑的线路并驯服猛犸象。这是夺回我们生命的唯一方法。

**Part 2: Taming the Mammoth**

**第二部分：驯服猛犸象**

Some people are born with a reasonably tame mammoth or raised with parenting that helps keep the mammoth in check. Others die without ever reining their mammoth in at all, spending their whole lives at its whim. Most of us are somewhere in the middle—we’ve got control of our mammoth in certain areas of our lives while it wreaks havoc in others. Being run by your mammoth doesn’t make you a bad or weak person—it just means you haven’t yet figured out how to get a grip on it. You might not even be aware that you have a mammoth at all or of the extent to which your Authentic Voice has been silenced.

有些人天生就有一只相当驯服的猛犸象，或者在父母的养育下长大，这有助于控制猛犸象。还有一些人死后根本没有控制住自己的猛犸象，一生都在它的心血来潮中度过。我们大多数人都处于中间状态——我们在生活的某些领域控制着猛犸象，而它却在其他领域造成严重破坏。被你的猛犸象控制并不会让你成为一个坏人或软弱的人——这只意味着你还没有弄清楚如何控制它。你甚至可能根本不知道你有一头猛犸象，也不知道你的真实声音被压制到了何种程度。

Whatever your situation, there are three steps to getting your mammoth under your control:

无论您的情况如何，都可以通过三个步骤来控制您的猛犸象：

**Step 1: Examine Yourself 第一步：审视自己**

The first step to improving things is a clear and honest assessment of what’s going on in your head, and there are three parts of this:

改进的第一步是对你头脑中发生的事情进行清晰而诚实的评估，其中包括三个部分：

**1) Get to know your Authentic Voice

1）了解你真实的声音**

This doesn’t sound that hard, but it is. It takes some serious reflection to sift through the webs of other people’s thoughts and opinions and figure out who the real you actually is. You spend time with a lot of people—which of them do you actually like the most? How do you spend your leisure time, and do you truly enjoy all parts of it? Is there anything you regularly spend money on that you don’t feel that comfortable with? How does your gut really feel about your job and relationship status? What’s your true political opinion? Do you even care? Do you pretend to care about things you don’t just to have an opinion? Do you secretly have an opinion on a political or moral issue you don’t ever voice because people you know will be outraged?

这听起来并不难，但确实如此。需要认真反思才能筛选出其他人的想法和观点，并找出真正的你是谁。你和很多人一起度过了时光——你实际上最喜欢他们中的哪一个？您如何度过闲暇时间？您是否真正享受其中的所有部分？有没有什么是你经常花钱却感觉不舒服的？您的直觉对您的工作和人际关系状况有何真实感受？你真正的政治观点是什么？你还关心吗？你是否假装关心你不关心的事情，而不仅仅是为了发表意见？您是否暗地里对政治或道德问题有自己的看法，但您从未表达过，因为您认识的人会被激怒？

There are cliché phrases for this process—”soul-searching” or “finding yourself”—but that’s exactly what needs to happen. Maybe you can reflect on this from whatever chair you’re sitting in right now or from some other part of your normal life—or maybe you need to go somewhere far away, by yourself, and step out of your life in order to effectively examine it. Either way, you’ve got to figure out what *actually* matters to you and start being proud of whoever your Authentic Voice is.

这个过程有一些陈词滥调——“自我反省”或“发现自己”——但这正是需要发生的。也许你可以从你现在坐在的任何椅子上或从你正常生活的其他部分来反思这一点——或者也许你需要独自去一个遥远的地方，走出你的生活，以便有效地审视这一点。它。无论哪种方式，你都必须弄清楚什么对你来说真正重要，并开始为你的真实声音感到自豪。

**2) Figure out where the mammoth is hiding

2）找出猛犸象藏身的地方**

[![mammoth hiding](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mammoth-hiding-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/mammoth-hiding.png)

Most of the time a mammoth is in control of a person, the person’s not really aware of it. But you can’t make progress if you’re not crystal clear about where the biggest problem areas are.

大多数时候，猛犸象控制着一个人，而这个人并没有真正意识到这一点。但如果你不清楚最大的问题领域在哪里，你就无法取得进展。

**The most obvious way to find the mammoth is to figure out where your fear is**—where are you most susceptible to shame or embarrassment? What parts of your life do you think about and a dreadful, sinking feeling washes over you? Where does the prospect of failure seem like a nightmare? What are you too timid to publicly try even though you know you’re good at it? If you were giving advice to yourself, which parts of your life would clearly need a change that you’re avoiding acting on right now?

找到猛犸象最明显的方法就是找出你的恐惧在哪里——你最容易感到羞耻或尴尬的地方在哪里？当你想到生活的哪些部分时，你会感到一种可怕的、沮丧的感觉？失败的前景在哪里看起来像是一场噩梦？尽管你知道自己很擅长，但你还是太胆怯而不敢公开尝试什么？如果你给自己提供建议，你生活中的哪些部分显然需要改变，而你现在却避免采取行动？

**The second place a mammoth hides is in the way-too-good feelings you get from feeling accepted or on a pedestal over other people.** Are you a serious *pleaser* at work or in your relationship? Are you terrified of disappointing your parents and do you choose making them proud over aiming to gratify yourself? Do you get too excited about being associated with prestigious things or care too much about status? Do you brag more than you should?

猛犸象隐藏的第二个地方是你因被接受或高高在上的感觉而获得的太好的感觉。在工作或人际关系中，你是一个认真取悦他人的人吗？你是否害怕让父母失望，你是否选择让他们感到骄傲而不是为了让自己满意？你是否因为与有声望的事物联系在一起而感到太兴奋，或者太在乎地位？你是否夸夸其谈？

**A third area the mammoth is present is anywhere you don’t feel comfortable making a decision without “permission” or approval from others.** Do you have opinions you’re regurgitating from someone else’s mouth, which you’re comfortable having now that you know that person has them? When you introduce your new girlfriend or boyfriend to your friends or family for the first time, can those people’s reaction to your new person fundamentally change your feelings for him/her? Is there a Puppet Master in your life? If so, who, and why?

猛犸象出现的第三个区域是在未经他人“许可”或批准的情况下您不愿意做出决定的任何地方。你是否有一些从别人嘴里吐出来的观点，而你现在知道那个人有这些观点，你对此感到很舒服？当你第一次向你的朋友或家人介绍你的新女朋友或男朋友时，那些人对你的新朋友的反应会从根本上改变你对他/她的感情吗？你的生活中有傀儡师吗？如果有，是谁，为什么？

**3) Decide where the mammoth needs to be ousted

3）决定在哪里需要驱逐猛犸象**

[![ousted](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ousted1-962x1024.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ousted1.png)

It’s not realistic to kick the mammoth entirely out of your head—you’re a human and humans have mammoths in their head, period. The thing we all need to do is carve out certain sacred areas of our lives that *must* be in the hands of the AV and free of mammoth influence. There are obvious areas that need to be made part of the AV’s domain like your choice of life partner, your career path, and the way you raise your kids. Others are personal—it comes down to the question, “In which parts of your life must you be entirely true to yourself?”

将猛犸象完全从你的头脑中踢出去是不现实的——你是一个人类，而人类的头脑里就有猛犸象，就这样。我们所有人需要做的就是在我们的生活中开辟出某些神圣的领域，这些领域必须掌握在反病毒软件的手中，并且不受巨大的影响。有一些明显的领域需要成为 AV 领域的一部分，例如您选择的生活伴侣、您的职业道路以及您抚养孩子的方式。其他的则是个人的——这归结为一个问题：“在你生活的哪些部分你必须完全忠于自己？”

**Step 2: Gather Courage by Internalizing That the Mammoth Has a Low IQ

第二步：通过内化猛犸象智商低来鼓起勇气**

Real Woolly Mammoths were unimpressive enough to go extinct, and Social Survival Mammoths aren’t any better. Despite the fact that they haunt us so, our mammoths are dumb, primitive creatures who have no understanding of the modern world. Deeply understanding this—and *internalizing* it—is a key step to taming yours. There are two major reasons not to take your mammoth seriously:

真正的长毛猛犸象的表现并不令人印象深刻，以至于已经灭绝，而社会生存型猛犸象也好不到哪里去。尽管它们如此困扰着我们，但我们的猛犸象是愚蠢的、原始的生物，对现代世界一无所知。深刻理解这一点并将其内化是驯服你的关键一步。不认真对待你的猛犸象有两个主要原因：

**1) The mammoth’s fears are totally irrational.

1）猛犸象的恐惧是完全不合理的。**

5 things the Mammoth is incorrect about:

猛犸象的错误有 5 件事：

→ **Everyone is talking about me and my life and just think how much everyone will be talking about it if I do this risky or weird thing.**

→ 每个人都在谈论我和我的生活，想想如果我做了这件危险或奇怪的事情，每个人都会谈论多少。

Here’s how the mammoth thinks things are:

猛犸象的想法是这样的：

[![circles](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/circles.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/circles.png)

Here’s how things actually are:

事情的实际情况是这样的：

[![Circle](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/circles-2-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/circles-2.png)

No one really cares that much about what you’re doing. People are highly self-absorbed.

没有人真正关心你在做什么。人们都是高度自我陶醉的。

→ **If I try really hard, I can please everyone.**

→ 如果我真的努力的话，我就能让大家满意。

Yes, maybe in a 40-person tribe with a unified culture. But in today’s world, no matter who you are, a bunch of people will like you and a bunch of other people won’t. Being approved of by one type of person means turning another off. So obsessing over fitting in with any one group is illogical, especially if that group isn’t really who you are. You’ll do all that work, and meanwhile, your actual favorite people are off being friends with each other somewhere else.

是的，也许是在一个有统一文化的 40 人部落中。但在当今世界，无论你是谁，都会有一群人喜欢你，而另一些人则不会。得到一种人的认可就意味着另一种人的反感。因此，痴迷于融入任何一个群体是不合逻辑的，特别是如果那个群体并不真正是你的话。你将完成所有这些工作，与此同时，你真正喜欢的人却在其他地方成为朋友。

→ **Being disapproved of or looked down upon or shit-talked about has real consequences in my life.**

→ 被不赞成、被轻视或被人议论会对我的生活产生真正的影响。

Anyone who disapproves of who you’re being or what you’re doing isn’t even in the same room with you 99.7% of the time. It’s a classic mammoth mistake to fabricate a vision of future social consequences that is *way* worse than what actually ends up happening—which is usually nothing at all.

99.7% 的时间里，那些不同意你的身份或行为的人甚至都不和你在同一个房间。编造出比实际发生的情况更糟糕的未来社会后果的愿景，这是一个典型的巨大错误——而实际上最终发生的情况通常根本没有发生。

→ **Really judgy people matter.**

→ 真正挑剔的人很重要。

Here’s how judgy people function: They’re highly mammoth-controlled and become good friends with and date other judgy people who are also highly mammoth-controlled. One of the primary activities they do together is talk shit about whoever’s not with them—maybe they feel some jealousy, and eye-rolling disapproval helps them flip the script and feel less jealous, or maybe they’re not jealous and use someone as a vehicle for bathing in [schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)—but whatever the underlying feeling, the judging serves to feed their hungry mammoth.

挑剔的人的运作方式是这样的：他们高度猛犸控制，并与其他同样高度猛犸控制的挑剔的人成为好朋友并约会。他们一起做的主要活动之一就是谈论不和他们在一起的人的坏话——也许他们感到嫉妒，而翻白眼的反对帮助他们改变剧本，减少嫉妒，或者也许他们并不嫉妒，而是利用某人作为他们的朋友。幸灾乐祸的工具——但无论潜在的感觉如何，评判都是为了喂饱他们饥饿的猛犸象。

When people shit-talk, they set up a category division of which they’re always on the right side. They do this to prop themselves up on a pedestal that their mammoth can chomp away on.

当人们胡言乱语时，他们会建立一个类别划分，而他们总是站在正确的一边。它们这样做是为了将自己支撑在一个基座上，以便它们的猛犸象可以啃咬。

Being the material a judgy person uses to feel good about themselves is a fairly infuriating thought—but it has no actual consequences and it’s clearly all much more about the judgy person and their mammoth problem than it is about you. If you find yourself making decisions partially based on not being talked badly about by a judgy person, think hard about what’s actually going on and stop.

成为一个挑剔的人用来自我感觉良好的材料是一个相当令人恼火的想法，但它没有实际后果，而且显然更多的是关于挑剔的人和他们的巨大问题，而不是关于你。如果你发现自己做出的决定部分是基于没有被一个挑剔的人说坏话，请认真思考到底发生了什么，然后停下来。

→ **I’m a bad person if I disappoint or offend the person/people who love me and have invested so much in me.**

→ 如果我令爱我并为我投入如此多的人失望或冒犯，我就是一个坏人。

No. You’re not a bad person for being whoever your Authentic Voice is in your one life. This is one of those simple things—if they truly selflessly love you, they will for sure come around and accept everything once they see that you’re happy. If you’re happy and they still don’t come around, here’s what’s happening: their strong feelings about who you should be or what you should do are *their mammoth talking*, and their main motivation is worrying about how it’ll “look” to other people who know them. They’re allowing their mammoth to override their love for you, and they should be adamantly ignored.

不。无论你一生中的真实声音是谁，你都不是一个坏人。这是一件简单的事情——如果他们真正无私地爱你，一旦看到你幸福，他们肯定会回心转意并接受一切。如果你很高兴，但他们仍然不回心转意，那么正在发生的事情是这样的：他们对你应该成为谁或你应该做什么的强烈感觉是他们的滔滔不绝，而他们的主要动机是担心它会“看起来”如何给其他认识他们的人。他们让他们的猛犸象压倒了他们对你的爱，他们应该被坚决忽视。

Two other reasons why the mammoth’s fearful obsession with social approval makes no sense:

猛犸象对社会认可的可怕痴迷毫无意义，还有另外两个原因：

**A) You live here: A) 你住在这里：**

[![Earth](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Earth-1024x785.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Earth.png)

So who gives a fuck about anything?

那么谁在乎任何事情呢？

**B) You and everyone you know are going to die. Kind of soon.**

**B) 你和你认识的每个人都会死。有点快了。**

[![die](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/die-1024x561.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/die.png)

So like…yeah. 就像……是的。

The mammoth’s fears being irrational is one reason the mammoth has a low IQ. Here’s the second:

猛犸象的非理性恐惧是猛犸象智商低的原因之一。这是第二个：

**2) The mammoth’s efforts are counterproductive.**

**2）猛犸象的努力适得其反。**

The irony of the whole thing is that the obsessive lumbering mammoth isn’t even good at his job. His methods of winning approval may have been effective in simpler times, but today, they’re transparent and off-putting. The modern world is an AV’s world, and if the mammoth wants to thrive socially, he should do the thing that scares him most—let the AV take over. Here’s why:

整件事的讽刺之处在于，这只笨重的猛犸象甚至不擅长他的工作。他赢得认可的方法在简单的时代可能很有效，但今天，它们是透明的且令人反感的。现代世界是自动驾驶的世界，如果猛犸象想要在社交方面蓬勃发展，他应该做他最害怕的事情——让自动驾驶接管。原因如下：

**AVs are interesting. Mammoths are boring.** Every AV is unique and complex, which is inherently interesting. Mammoths are all the same—they copy and conform, and their motives aren’t based on anything authentic or real, just on doing what they think they’re supposed to do. That’s supremely boring.

AV 很有趣。猛犸象很无聊。每个 AV 都是独特且复杂的，这本身就很有趣。猛犸象都是一样的——它们模仿和顺从，它们的动机不是基于任何真实的或真实的东西，只是做它们认为它们应该做的事情。这太无聊了。

**AVs lead. Mammoths follow.** Leadership is natural for most AVs, because they draw their thoughts and opinions from an original place, which gives them an original angle. And if they’re smart and innovative enough, they can change things in the world and invent things that disrupt the status quo. If you give someone a paintbrush and an empty canvas, they might not paint something good—but they’ll change the canvas in one way or another.

AV 领先。猛犸象紧随其后。对于大多数 AV 来说，领导力是很自然的，因为他们从原始的地方汲取想法和意见，这给了他们一个原始的角度。如果他们足够聪明和创新，他们就可以改变世界并发明打破现状的东西。如果你给某人一把画笔和一张空画布，他们可能画不出好东西，但他们会以某种方式改变画布。

Mammoths, on the other hand, follow—by definition. That’s what they were built to do—blend in and follow the leader. The last thing a mammoth is going to do is change the status quo because it’s trying so hard to *be* the status quo. When you give someone a paintbrush and canvas, but the paint is the same exact color as the canvas, they can paint all they want, but they won’t change anything.

另一方面，根据定义，猛犸象紧随其后。这就是他们生来的目的——融入并跟随领导者。猛犸象最不愿意做的事情就是改变现状，因为它非常努力地维持现状。当你给某人一支画笔和画布，但颜料与画布的颜色完全相同时，他们可以画出他们想要的任何东西，但他们不会改变任何东西。

**People gravitate toward AVs, not mammoths.** The only time a mammoth-crazed person is appealing on a first date is when they’re on the date with another mammoth-crazed person. People with a strong AV see through mammoth-controlled people and aren’t attracted to them. A friend of mine was dating a great on-paper guy awhile back but broke things off because she couldn’t quite fall for him. She tried to articulate why, saying he wasn’t weird or special enough—he seemed like “just one of the guys.” In other words, he was being run too much by a mammoth.

人们更喜欢自动驾驶汽车，而不是猛犸象。一个猛犸象狂热者在第一次约会时唯一有吸引力的时候是当他们与另一个猛犸象狂热者约会时。拥有强大 AV 的人能够看穿被猛犸控制的人，并且不会被他们吸引。我的一个朋友不久前正在和一个纸上谈兵的好男人约会，但后来分手了，因为她不太喜欢他。她试图阐明原因，说他不够奇怪或特别——他看起来“只是其中之一”。换句话说，他被猛犸象追赶得太多了。

This also holds among friends or colleagues, where AV-run people are more respected and more magnetic—not because there’s necessarily anything extraordinary about them, but because *people respect someone with the strength of character to have tamed their mammoth.*

这在朋友或同事之间也是如此，驾驶自动驾驶汽车的人更受尊重，也更有吸引力——并不是因为他们一定有什么非凡的地方，而是因为人们尊重那些有坚强的性格来驯服猛犸象的人。

**Step 3: Start Being Yourself**

**第三步：开始做你自己**

This post was all fun and games until “start being yourself” came into the picture. Up to now, this has been an interesting reflection into why humans care so much what other people think, why that’s bad, how it’s a problem in your life, and why there’s no good reason it should continue to plague you. But actually *doing* something after you finish reading this article is a whole different thing. That takes more than reflection—it takes some courage.

这篇文章充满了乐趣和游戏，直到“开始做你自己”出现。到目前为止，这已经有趣地反映了为什么人类如此关心别人的想法，为什么这是不好的，它如何成为你生活中的一个问题，以及为什么没有充分的理由它应该继续困扰你。但读完本文后实际做一些事情是完全不同的事情。这需要的不仅仅是反思，还需要一些勇气。

[![toe in water](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/toe-in-water-1024x599.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/toe-in-water.png)

But courage against *what,* exactly? As we’ve discussed, there’s no actual danger involved in being yourself—more than anything, it just takes an Emperor Has No Clothes epiphany, which is as simple as this:

但勇气到底是针对什么？正如我们所讨论的，做你自己并没有真正的危险——最重要的是，它只需要皇帝无衣的顿悟，就这么简单：

**Almost nothing you’re socially scared of is actually scary.**

**几乎没有什么让你在社交上感到害怕的事情实际上是可怕的。**

Absorbing this thought will diminish the fear that you feel, and without fear, the mammoth loses some power.

吸收这种想法会减少你感受到的恐惧，而没有恐惧，猛犸象就会失去一些力量。

[![medium mammoth](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/medium-mammoth1.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/medium-mammoth1.png)

With a weakened mammoth, it becomes possible to begin standing up for who you are and even making some bold changes—and when you watch those changes turn out well for you with few negative consequences and no regrets, it reinforces the epiphany and an empowered AV becomes a habit. Your mammoth has now lost its ability to pull the strings, and it’s tamed.

对于一头虚弱的猛犸象，你可以开始坚持自己的身份，甚至做出一些大胆的改变——当你看到这些改变对你来说效果很好，几乎没有负面后果，也不后悔时，它会强化顿悟和增强的 AV成为一种习惯。你的猛犸象现在已经失去了幕后操纵的能力，并且已经被驯服了。

[![small mammoth](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/small-mammoth.png)](https://149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/small-mammoth.png)

The mammoth is still with you—it’ll always be with you—but you’ll have an easier time ignoring or overruling it when it speaks up or acts out, because the AV is the alpha dog now. You can start to relish the feeling of being viewed as weird or inappropriate or confusing to people, and society becomes your playground and blank canvas, not something to grovel before and hope for acceptance from.

猛犸象仍然和你在一起——它会永远和你在一起——但当它说话或表现出来时，你会更容易忽视或推翻它，因为 AV 现在是头号狗。你可以开始享受被人视为奇怪、不恰当或令人困惑的感觉，社会就成为你的游乐场和空白画布，而不是卑躬屈膝并希望被接受的东西。

Making this shift isn’t easy for anyone, but it’s worth obsessing over. Your Authentic Voice has been given one life—and it’s your job to make sure it gets the opportunity to live it.

做出这种转变对任何人来说都不容易，但值得痴迷。您的真实声音已被赋予了生命，而您的工作就是确保它有机会实现它。
