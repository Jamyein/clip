## Many languages have very few odour-related words, so conveying what a scent is like requires knowing your audience

许多语言中很少有与气味相关的单词，因此传达气味需要了解您的受众

It can be hard to describe smells. At times, you might feel as if certain odours are ineffable. You sniff a perfume or a spice mix, and the smells seem familiar. But as soon as you attempt to describe them, you hesitate, searching for the right words. It is well known within the cognitive sciences that people are typically not very good at identifying even familiar smells, such as garlic, peanut butter or lemon – study participants [rarely](https://benjamins.com/catalog/aicr.85.13jon) get it right more than 50 per cent of the time in the absence of images or labels. This is in dramatic contrast to the ability to *visually* identify garlic, peanut butter and lemons. Why this discrepancy between the two senses?

很难描述气味。有时，您可能会觉得某些气味难以形容。你闻香水或香料混合物，气味似乎很熟悉。但一旦你试图描述它们，你就会犹豫，寻找合适的词语。在认知科学领域众所周知，即使是熟悉的气味，例如大蒜、花生酱或柠檬，人们通常也不太擅长识别——研究参与者在没有图像或没有图像的情况下，很少能在超过 50% 的时间内正确识别出气味。标签。这与视觉识别大蒜、花生酱和柠檬的能力形成鲜明对比。为什么这两种感觉之间存在这种差异？

The difficulty with classifying smells is at least in part due to a lack of words for them. Consider colours. We have many words that specifically refer to colours, that can be used for all sorts of coloured things, and that are used widely and uniformly. *Red* picks out a colour and can be applied to cars, apples, birds and many other things that share the colour. Even young children know how to use the word *red* with confidence. But contemporary linguists agree that many languages lack an ‘olfactory lexicon’ – that is, a set of words that pick out smell-related qualities, that can be applied to different kinds of things that share a smell, and that are widely and uniformly used.

对气味进行分类的困难至少部分是由于缺乏描述它们的词语。考虑颜色。我们有许多专门指代颜色的单词，可以用于各种有颜色的事物，并且使用广泛且统一。红色挑选出一种颜色，可以应用于汽车、苹果、鸟类和许多其他具有相同颜色的物体。即使是小孩子也知道如何自信地使用红色这个词。但当代语言学家一致认为，许多语言缺乏“嗅觉词典”，即一组能够挑选出与气味相关的品质的单词，这些单词可以应用于具有相同气味的不同种类的事物，并且被广泛且统一地使用。

In English, there is a relatively small number of smell terms, such as *scented*, *smelly* and *stinky*. What these terms tell us is that something has or gives off a smell, and they might indicate whether something has a good smell (eg, *fragrant*) or a bad smell (eg, *acrid*). Evaluating whether a smell is good or bad is very important – a bad smell can be a danger signal, for instance. But such language is still fairly vague about what the smell is actually like. Many other languages share with English the lack of a smell lexicon. (How are things in your mother tongue? Can you think of an olfactory word that works the way *red* does for colour?) Smells, linguists conclude, are generally not very expressible in language.

在英语中，气味术语的数量相对较少，例如scented、smoke、stunky等。这些术语告诉我们的是某物具有或散发出气味，并且它们可能表明某物是否具有好气味（例如，芳香）或难闻气味（例如，辛辣）。评估气味是好是坏非常重要——例如，难闻的气味可能是危险信号。但这样的语言对于气味的实际情况仍然相当模糊。许多其他语言与英语一样缺乏气味词典。 （你的母语里的东西怎么样？你能想出一个嗅觉词，就像红色代表颜色一样吗？）语言学家得出的结论是，气味通常很难用语言表达。

Now, this is not a universal fact. As a [bod](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(20)30277-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661320302771%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)[y](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(20)30277-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661320302771%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) of [work](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027713002527) by the cognitive scientist Asifa Majid and colleagues is revealing, there are some languages with rich olfactory lexica, especially within hunter-gatherer societies. The Jahai language, as Majid and Niclas Burenhult have [reported](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771300214X?via%3Dihub), has one single word ‘for the smell of petrol, smoke, bat droppings and bat caves, some species of millipede, root of wild ginger, leaf of gingerwort, wood of wild mango, among other odour sources’. Speakers of such languages also happen to be much better than most of us at correctly and consistently identifying smells. A significant factor in explaining these cross-linguistic differences is likely related to lifestyle: if smells are very important within a linguistic community because they are key to information about food sources and dangers, say, then smells will be talked about more. In turn, this likely leads to broader agreement on words for smells across speakers, and to the development of a stable olfactory lexicon.

现在，这并不是一个普遍的事实。认知科学家阿西法·马吉德 (Asifa Majid) 及其同事的一系列研究工作表明，有些语言拥有丰富的嗅觉词汇，尤其是在狩猎采集社会中。据马吉德和尼古拉斯·布伦胡特报道，贾海语中有一个词“代表汽油、烟雾、蝙蝠粪便和蝙蝠洞、某些千足虫、野姜根、姜叶、野芒果木、除其他气味源外”。说这种语言的人在正确、一致地识别气味方面也比我们大多数人要好得多。解释这些跨语言差异的一个重要因素可能与生活方式有关：如果气味在语言社区中非常重要，因为它们是有关食物来源和危险的信息的关键，那么气味就会被更多地谈论。反过来，这可能会导致不同说话者对气味词汇达成更广泛的共识，并形成稳定的嗅觉词典。

Describing by way of comparison has limitations and imposes specific requirements on speakers

比较式描述有局限性，对说话人有特定要求

Even in the absence of such a lexicon, of course, people still think about, classify, and talk about smells. We do so even in English, French, German, Italian and other languages without specialised smell words. Obvious examples are domains and subcultures in which scents are very important, such as among [wine](https://psyche.co/guides/how-do-you-select-a-bottle-of-wine-that-youll-enjoy) professionals. More generally, most people know what it means for something to smell ‘like strawberries’ or ‘of freshly cut grass’, or to have ‘an old-book smell’. But these are not specifically olfactory terms; they are not analogous to colour adjectives.

当然，即使没有这样的词典，人们仍然会思考、分类和谈论气味。即使在英语、法语、德语、意大利语和其他没有专门气味词的语言中，我们也会这样做。明显的例子是气味非常重要的领域和亚文化，例如葡萄酒专业人士。更一般地说，大多数人都知道某种东西闻起来“像草莓”或“新割草的味道”或“有旧书的味道”意味着什么。但这些并不是专门针对嗅觉的术语；而是专门针对嗅觉的术语。它们与颜色形容词不同。

**What these descriptions do** **is draw** a kind of [comparison](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mila.12440). In saying ‘this bodywash smells like strawberries’, you convey that the bodywash has a smell that is similar to the characteristic smell of strawberries. Other kinds of smell descriptions can also be understood as explicit or implicit comparisons: for instance, you can say that something has a ‘chocolate smell’ or smells ‘burnt’ (like charred wood). The strategy of describing by comparing is pervasive.

这些描述的目的是进行一种比较。当您说“这款沐浴露闻起来像草莓”时，您传达的是沐浴露具有类似于草莓特有气味的气味。其他类型的气味描述也可以理解为显式或隐式比较：例如，您可以说某物具有“巧克力味”或“烧焦味”（如烧焦的木头）。通过比较来描述的策略是普遍存在的。

This simple idea can help us understand why people generally manage to understand each other despite lacking a standardised olfactory lexicon. It can also help explain some of the obstacles we encounter. Describing by way of comparison has limitations and imposes specific requirements on speakers.

这个简单的想法可以帮助我们理解为什么人们在缺乏标准化的嗅觉词汇的情况下通常能够相互理解。它还可以帮助解释我们遇到的一些障碍。通过比较的方式进行描述有其局限性，并且对说话者提出了特定的要求。

In general, your smell descriptions will be understood if they make reference to things that are salient within your linguistic community and are associated with recognisable smells. It may be the case that your grandma’s house had a very distinctive smell that impressed itself in your memory. But, since most people won’t know what that smell is like, saying ‘this smells like my grandma’s house’ is not going to take you very far. There has to be a shared reference point. Sometimes, this may be one very specific thing that has one unique smell – such as Chanel No 5 perfume. Other times, the reference point is a broader category that encompasses a fairly wide range of smells. For example: ‘This perfume has a *floral* smell.’ Flowers can have all sorts of smells, and yet people have a sense of what that description means.

一般来说，如果您的气味描述提到了您的语言社区中突出的事物并且与可识别的气味相关，那么您的气味描述就会被理解。也许你奶奶的房子里有一种非常独特的气味，在你的记忆中留下了深刻的印象。但是，由于大多数人不知道那种气味是什么样的，所以说“这闻起来像我奶奶的房子”并不会让你走得太远。必须有一个共享的参考点。有时，这可能是一种非常具体的东西，具有一种独特的气味 - 例如香奈儿 5 号香水。其他时候，参考点是一个更广泛的类别，包含相当广泛的气味。例如：“这款香水有花香。”花可以有各种各样的气味，但人们都能理解这种描述的含义。

To communicate effectively about smells, you need to know your audience. Our past experiences, culture and environment affect what odorous things we typically encounter, and thus shape the descriptions we choose. You might say of something ‘This smells like popcorn,’ as that would be the obvious exemplar of a certain kind of smell, at least for you and the people in your life. But someone with a different cultural background might equally aptly say ‘This smells like binturong’ – an animal that [gives off](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-016-1361-4) the same toasted, buttery smell as popcorn. Or think of the description ‘Christmassy smell’. It can be very evocative, but again, it’s dependent on shared culture: some associate the festive season with cinnamon and orange smells, some with wintergreen smells, others with none of these.

为了有效地传达有关气味的信息，您需要了解您的受众。我们过去的经历、文化和环境会影响我们通常遇到的有气味的事物，从而影响我们选择的描述。你可能会说“这闻起来像爆米花”，因为这将是某种气味的明显典范，至少对你和你生活中的人来说是这样。但具有不同文化背景的人可能会同样恰当地说“这闻起来像熊狸”——一种散发出与爆米花相同的烤黄油气味的动物。或者想想“圣诞气味”这个描述。它可能非常令人回味，但同样，它取决于共同的文化：有些人将节日与肉桂和橙子的气味联系起来，有些人与冬青气味联系在一起，有些人则没有这些气味。

Smell talk is anchored in a familiarity with a shared world of odorous things

气味谈话的基础是对有气味的事物的共同世界的熟悉

One of my favourite examples of a smell being described in different ways that might appeal to different audiences comes from the YouTuber Krist Yu’s [video review](https://youtu.be/2s0VbOErTLA) of ‘bougie’ candles – specifically, her husband’s descriptions of the scents. One candle ‘smells like an old man covering his cigarette smell with cologne’; another ‘smells like a lime that took a shower’. While these descriptions may initially strike you as a little silly, many viewers in the video’s comment section agree that they were actually quite useful for imagining what the scents were like. Yu also reports the ‘notes’ in each scent as described by the candle sellers. Notes for the second candle include grapefruit, cedarwood, patchouli, geranium, amber and vetiver. Maybe you are into perfumes, and so references to these sources of smells are quite helpful to you. But I honestly have no idea what many of these things smell like. A lime that took a shower, on the other hand – I get that.

我最喜欢的一个以不同方式描述气味的例子，可能会吸引不同的观众，来自 YouTuber Krist Yu 对“bougie”蜡烛的视频评论——具体来说，是她丈夫对气味的描述。一支蜡烛“闻起来就像一位老人用古龙水掩盖了烟味”；另一种“闻起来像洗过澡的酸橙”。虽然这些描述一开始可能会让你觉得有点傻，但视频评论部分的许多观众都同意，它们实际上对于想象气味非常有用。于还报告了蜡烛销售商所描述的每种气味中的“香调”。第二支蜡烛的香调包括葡萄柚、雪松、广藿香、天竺葵、琥珀和香根草。也许您喜欢香水，因此提及这些气味来源对您非常有帮助。但老实说，我不知道其中许多东西闻起来是什么味道。另一方面，洗过澡的酸橙——我明白了。

**Multiple possible descriptions, then, can be** equally apt for the very same smell. It just depends on the speaker, the audience, and what they share.

那么，多种可能的描述可以同样适用于同一种气味。这仅取决于演讲者、听众以及他们分享的内容。

Without shared conventions, people are likely to describe the same smell in discrepant ways and may fail to understand each other’s descriptions. Individuals actually can perceive scents differently as a result of [genetic](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature06162) variation, but a difference in description does not always mean there is a difference in perception. Rather, the words people choose reflect their past experiences, culture, and the environment they are used to. So when two or more people manage to understand each other while talking about smells by means of comparison, that suggests at least somewhat overlapping experiences. Smell talk is anchored in a familiarity with a shared world of odorous things – such as those limes that many people know from encounters with guacamole and mojitos.

如果没有共同的约定，人们可能会以不同的方式描述相同的气味，并且可能无法理解彼此的描述。由于基因变异，个体实际上对气味的感知不同，但描述的差异并不总是意味着感知的差异。相反，人们选择的词语反映了他们过去的经历、文化和习惯的环境。因此，当两个或更多的人在通过比较谈论气味时设法相互理解时，这表明至少在某种程度上有重叠的经历。气味谈话的基础是对有气味的事物的共同世界的熟悉——例如许多人通过接触鳄梨酱和莫吉托而认识的酸橙。

The strategy of describing by comparing is not unique to smell. While English does have specific words for visual, audible, tactile and gustatory qualities (such as *pink*, *loud*, *rough* and *sour*), even descriptions of these senses very often appeal to familiar things that people can see, hear, touch or taste. You might say that peaches ‘look ripe’ or ‘like doughnuts’, that something ‘sounds empty’ or ‘like a large dog’, that a fabric ‘feels like velvet’, that a cake ‘has a coffee taste’. This strategy allows you to be more precise and informative than if you used only words like *pink*, *round* or *loud*. (In the 2021 film *Memoria*, a character played by Tilda Swinton [describes](https://youtu.be/olNvmUCmY8o) a recurring sound that she hears as like ‘a big ball of concrete that falls into a metal well which is surrounded by seawater’.) Even in the case of colour, many shades are described with words for things that typically have those colours, such as mint, ochre or peach.

通过比较来描述的策略并不是气味所独有的。虽然英语确实有专门的词汇来表示视觉、听觉、触觉和味觉品质（例如粉红色、响亮、粗糙和酸味），但即使是对这些感官的描述也常常诉诸人们可以看到、听到、触摸或品尝的熟悉事物。你可能会说桃子“看起来成熟了”或“像甜甜圈”，有些东西“听起来空虚”或“像一只大狗”，布料“感觉像天鹅绒”，蛋糕“有咖啡的味道”。与仅使用“粉红色”、“圆形”或“响亮”等词语相比，这种策略可以让您获得更精确、更丰富的信息。 （在 2021 年的电影《记忆》中，蒂尔达·斯文顿饰演的角色描述了一种反复出现的声音，她听到的声音就像“一个大混凝土球落入被海水包围的金属井中”。）即使在颜色方面，许多色调是用单词来描述通常具有这些颜色的事物，例如薄荷色、赭石色或桃色。

Yet comparisons across groups such as English speakers and hunter-gatherers like the Jahai indicate that the more that people within a culture care about a sensory modality, the more they talk about it and develop a rich, specialised language for doing so. Within mainstream Western cultures, vision [takes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027718301288) centre stage; if you went to school in one of these cultures, you were probably more likely to be taught words for colours and shapes than words for smells. When you talk about smells in English or a similar language, then, you need to draw on past experience and broader knowledge and, sometimes, get a bit creative. This makes those moments when two people encounter a new smell, and agree on a good description, a bit special: if you ‘get’ my description, we know we have something in common.

然而，对讲英语的人和像贾海人这样的狩猎采集者等群体的比较表明，一种文化中的人们越关心某种感官形态，他们就越会谈论它，并为此开发出一种丰富的、专门的语言。在西方主流文化中，视觉占据中心地位。如果你在其中一种文化中上学，你可能更有可能被教导有关颜色和形状的词语，而不是有关气味的词语。当您用英语或类似语言谈论气味时，您需要借鉴过去的经验和更广泛的知识，有时还需要一点创意。这使得两个人遇到一种新气味并就一个好的描述达成一致的时刻变得有点特别：如果你“明白”我的描述，我们就知道我们有一些共同点。
