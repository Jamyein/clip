I used to think of resourcefulness as a kind of practical intelligence, but I’ve recently started thinking of it as a combination of an energy state, an attitude, and an unexamined philosophy. A lived and embodied, but rarely articulated, *Weltenschauung*. Rarely articulated because the people living and embodying it are too busy being alive to indulge in the (let’s face it) slightly acting-dead game of articulating things.

我曾经认为足智多谋是一种实用智慧，但最近我开始将其视为一种能量状态、一种态度和一种未经检验的哲学的结合。一个活生生、具体化但很少被阐明的世界观。很少被清晰地表达出来，因为生活和体现它的人们太忙于活着而无法沉迷于（让我们面对现实）稍微装死的表达事物的游戏。

It is the philosopher’s conceit that the unexamined life is not worth living. The resourceful person, by simply existing, gives the lie to that self-congratulatory belief. While some resourceful people certainly do lack the capacity for critical reflection (as do many philosophers), it is by no means the case that *all* of them do. Many can be provoked into critical reflection even if they aren’t naturally prone to it, especially when it serves a practical purpose in unlocking a more resourceful direction to head in. But they are fundamentally bored by critical reflection, judging it to be (often correctly) a cope for people afraid to live life fully.

哲学家的自负是，未经审视的生活不值得过。足智多谋的人，仅仅通过存在，就揭穿了那种沾沾自喜的信念的谎言。虽然一些足智多谋的人确实缺乏批判性反思的能力（就像许多哲学家一样），但绝不是所有人都缺乏批判性反思的能力。许多人可能会被激发进行批判性反思，即使他们天生不倾向于批判性反思，尤其是当它具有实际目的，可以解锁更足智多谋的方向时。但他们从根本上对批判性反思感到厌倦，认为它是（通常是）正确的）对于那些害怕充分生活的人来说是一个应对之策。

So what is resourcefulness?

那么什么是足智多谋呢？

Resourcefulness is steady, patient, problem-solving persistence. A seemingly infinite capacity for a kind of trial-and-error that non-resourceful people would find impossibly draining and exhausting.

足智多谋是稳定、耐心、解决问题的坚持。看似无限的试错能力，对于足智多谋的人来说会发现难以置信的疲惫和疲惫。

I’m not myself a particularly resourceful person, but under moderate stress, I can turn into one — for a while. I think my limit is about a month at a stretch, and then I need 11 to recover. Resourceful people seem to *always* be in this state (though when they do crash out of it, they often end up in the darkest pit of despair for a while).

我自己并不是一个特别足智多谋的人，但在适度的压力下，我可以暂时成为一个足智多谋的人。我认为我的极限是连续一个月左右，然后我需要11个月才能恢复。足智多谋的人似乎总是处于这种状态（尽管当他们真正摆脱这种状态时，他们往往会陷入一段最黑暗的绝望深渊）。

A big part of resourcefulness, by definition, is of course a combination of imagination and attentiveness. You have to pay attention to an unsatisfactory situation to keep coming up with things to try. But there are many extraordinarily attentive and imaginative people who do interesting and creative work, but are not resourceful.

根据定义，足智多谋的很大一部分当然是想象力和注意力的结合。你必须注意不令人满意的情况，才能不断想出尝试的事情。但也有很多非常细心和富有想象力的人，他们做着有趣和有创造性的工作，但并不足智多谋。

Ironically, this attitude hobbles creative ambition because invariably, bigger and more complex creative projects repeatedly hit phases where resourcefulness rather than creativity is called for. If you’re a painter creating a revolutionary new kind of painting involving a specific shade of blue, but then you find you’re out of that blue paint and it’s out of stock everywhere, you’re suddenly faced with a *resourcefulness* problem. Find more paint somewhere, or improvise a creative alternative. Being a genius visionary painter doesn’t help you navigate confused conversations with random suppliers of blue paint in China.

具有讽刺意味的是，这种态度阻碍了创意雄心，因为更大、更复杂的创意项目总是会反复遇到需要机智而不是创造力的阶段。如果你是一名画家，正在创作一种涉及特定蓝色色调的革命性新型绘画，但随后你发现你的蓝色颜料用完了，而且到处都缺货，那么你突然面临着一个足智多谋的问题。在某处寻找更多油漆，或者即兴创作一个创造性的替代方案。作为一个天才、有远见的画家并不能帮助你与中国随机的蓝色油漆供应商进行混乱的对话。

Such non-resourceful artists are easily disheartened by the overwhelming weight of everyday annoyances and practical problems of varying degrees of difficulty, and grudge any effort that must be devoted to them. To such people, the need for resourcefulness is a tax on life rather than a part of it. To them, while you’re being “resourceful,” you’re not living. I have to admit, I belong in this club about half the time.

这些缺乏足智多谋的艺术家很容易因日常烦恼和不同难度的实际问题而感到沮丧，并不愿意为此付出任何努力。对于这些人来说，对足智多谋的需求是对生活的一种负担，而不是生活的一部分。对他们来说，当你“足智多谋”时，你并不是在生活。我必须承认，我大约有一半的时间属于这个俱乐部。

Resourcefulness is a positive syndrome combining patience, conscientiousness, curiosity, attentiveness, and most of all *energy*. The adjective *indefatigable* comes to mind. Not only do resourceful people never run out of things to try, they seem to never run out of energy to actually try them. Again and again, often racking up dozens of failed trials before hitting upon a successful one.

足智多谋是一种积极的综合症，结合了耐心、责任心、好奇心、专注力，最重要的是精力。我想到了形容词“不知疲倦”。足智多谋的人不仅永远不会尝试所有的事情，而且他们似乎永远不会耗尽实际尝试的精力。一次又一次，通常要经过数十次失败的尝试才能获得成功。

It’s not that the raw energy is special. We’re not talking extraordinary or heroic levels of physical or intellectual stamina. Nor are we talking about the closely related concept of resilience — the ability to not let setbacks get to you. It’s not that the resourceful person has astounding willpower or emotional self-regulation. It’s that they somehow seem to retain the motivation to keep going for far longer than most people, without visibly trying.

并不是说原始能量有什么特殊。我们并不是在谈论非凡或英雄般的体力或智力耐力。我们也不是在谈论密切相关的韧性概念——不让挫折降临到你身上的能力。并不是说足智多谋的人有惊人的意志力或情绪的自我调节能力。问题在于，他们似乎比大多数人更长久地保留着继续前进的动力，而没有明显的尝试。

This, I think, is key. If you’re gritting your teeth, fighting back depression and anxiety, picking yourself up and soldiering on, that’s heroic stamina and resilience. If it never even occurs to you to give up, that’s resourcefulness.

我认为这是关键。如果你咬紧牙关，对抗抑郁和焦虑，振作起来并继续前进，那就是英雄般的耐力和韧性。如果你从来没有想过放弃，那就是足智多谋。

Most of us have a kind of meta-process going on in our head anytime we’re in a trial-and-error mode. At what point do I cut my losses and quit? At what point do I just toss this frustrating broken thing and buy a new one? At what point do I just give up on a plan entirely and choose to forgo something?

每当我们处于试错模式时，我们大多数人的脑海中都会出现一种元过程。我什么时候应该减少损失并退出？我什么时候该扔掉这个令人沮丧的坏东西并买一个新的？什么时候我会完全放弃计划并选择放弃某些东西？

The resourceful person rarely asks *is this worth it,* because by a rarely questioned default, *it always is.* Resourceful people have extremely stable commitments to extremely stable goals and desires, *by default*. It’s not specific goals and desires. They’re that way about *all* goals or desires. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing.

足智多谋的人很少问这是否值得，因为在很少有人质疑的默认情况下，它总是值得的。默认情况下，足智多谋的人对极其稳定的目标和愿望有着极其稳定的承诺。这不是具体的目标和愿望。所有的目标或愿望都是如此。如果值得做，那就值得做。

When you consider that as a revealed *Weltenschauung,* a life-scale worldview and attitude, you could say that the resourceful person is one who has a remarkable level of faith in the idea that *of course* life is worth living. Unlike the philosopher who has to examine life to make it worth living, for the resourceful person, the answer is clear without any need for self-examination. The fully lived life is not worth examining.

当你认为这是一种揭示的世界观，一种生命尺度的世界观和态度时，你可以说足智多谋的人是一个对生活当然值得过的想法有着非凡信念的人。与哲学家必须审视生活以使其值得一过不同，对于足智多谋的人来说，答案是明确的，不需要任何自我审视。充实的生活不值得审视。

To the resourceful person, if you want something, that’s part of living life, so *of course* it’s worth relentless trial-and-error to get. To want at all is to want *life.* There is an endearing sort of infinite-game firmware loop deep down somewhere. The point of the resourceful life is to continue playing. To continue wanting.

对于足智多谋的人来说，如果你想要某样东西，那就是生活的一部分，所以当然值得不断地尝试和错误才能得到。想要什么就是想要生命。在某处深处有一种可爱的无限游戏固件循环。机智人生的意义就是继续玩。继续想要。

In a curious way, the superpower of the resourceful person is simply the ability to care deeply and unquestioningly about their own life. This is not the same thing as being selfish or narcissistic. In fact, many selfish and narcissistic people seem to constantly struggle with the question of whether their life is worth caring about enough to live.

奇怪的是，足智多谋的人的超能力就是能够深切地、毫无疑问地关心自己的生活。这与自私或自恋不是一回事。事实上，许多自私和自恋的人似乎一直在纠结自己的生活是否值得被足够关心的问题。

It’s not that resourceful people can’t do the pragmatic math of whether or not something — right up to their own life — is worth it. It’s not that are unable to consider whether it’s cheaper to toss something and buy a new thing than to continue messing with it. If that’s a necessary kind of processing they can do it. Others might have to help them snap them out of the get-it-done mode briefly, and help them reorient. Then they’re off again, cheerfully being indefatigably resourceful in the new direction.

这并不是说足智多谋的人无法实用地计算出某件事——甚至是他们自己的生命——是否值得。这并不是说无法考虑扔掉东西并购买新东西是否比继续弄乱它更便宜。如果这是必要的处理，他们可以做到。其他人可能必须帮助他们暂时摆脱“完成任务”模式，并帮助他们重新定位。然后他们又出发了，愉快地在新的方向上不知疲倦地足智多谋。

But it is important to note that snapping resourceful people into a reflective mode is not always a good thing to do.

但值得注意的是，让足智多谋的人进入反思模式并不总是一件好事。

Quite often, resourceful people are off chasing down a problem — like a show-stopping software bug or supply chain snafu — where their default *of course it is worth it* attitude is in fact the closest approximation to the right one. Anyone doing more shrinking, scarcity-minded cost-benefit analysis, and constantly evaluating the quit-or-not decision, is likely going dangerously wrong somewhere. The higher the stakes, the more these meta-processing second-guessing rational types are a liability to have around. Invariably, at some point they’ll manage to convince themselves the thing is not worth doing. Quitting behavior easily slides from strategic to addictive.

很多时候，足智多谋的人会去追寻一个问题——比如令人震惊的软件错误或供应链混乱——他们的默认态度实际上是最接近正确态度的，当然这是值得的。任何人如果进行更多的缩减、稀缺性成本效益分析，并不断评估是否退出的决定，都可能在某个地方犯下危险的错误。风险越高，这些元处理事后猜测的理性类型就越容易成为一种负担。总有一天，他们会设法说服自己这件事不值得做。戒烟行为很容易从策略性的行为转变为成瘾性的行为。

Often this is because as sunk costs rise, and you can’t actually justify walking away from them, it’s easier to just repress the fact that they exist and give up. If you bet the farm, you want to be relentlessly resourceful about making the bet pay off, and be on the lookout for quitting rationalizations based on dodgy philosophical math. The higher the stakes, the higher the chances rounding them up to infinity is the right answer, and rounding them down to zero as a write-off is self-deception.

通常这是因为随着沉没成本的上升，你实际上无法证明放弃它们是合理的，更容易压制它们存在的事实并放弃。如果你把赌注押在农场上，你就会想尽一切办法让赌注得到回报，并警惕放弃基于狡猾的哲学数学的合理化。赌注越高，正确答案四舍五入到无穷大的机会就越大，而将它们四舍五入到零作为冲销则是自欺欺人。

In a sufficiently complex world, only the unreasonable people for whom all bridges are by default burned are going to get anywhere. Everyone else will always find a reason to quit, and never get to any of the weirdly worthwhile outcomes that defy philosophical cost-benefit analysis.

在一个足够复杂的世界里，只有那些不讲道理的人，所有的桥梁都被默认烧毁了，才能有所成就。其他人总是会找到退出的理由，并且永远不会获得任何违背哲学成本效益分析的奇怪的有价值的结果。

Obviously, resourceful people make great COOs, bug-hunting programmers, and entrepreneurs in the more “operator” mold. But those stereotypically resourceful people are kinda uninteresting. What interests me a lot more is people who are relentlessly resourceful in the larger game of ordinary life, outside of hero’s journeys. People for whom resourcefulness is not just a way of life but the very definition of it, with anything short of an *of-course-it’s-worth-it* attitude being some degree of deadness.

显然，足智多谋的人会成为优秀的首席运营官、寻找错误的程序员以及更多“运营商”模式的企业家。但那些典型的足智多谋的人却有点无趣。我更感兴趣的是那些在英雄旅程之外的日常生活中足智多谋的人们。对他们来说，足智多谋不仅是一种生活方式，而且是它的定义，任何缺乏“当然值得”的态度都是某种程度的死亡。

As the world gets ever-more complex, it’s the resourceful who increasingly inherit the future. Anyone who wonders too long whether life is worth living is increasingly likely to conclude that it is not due to the sheer difficulty of thinking about the question honestly. Only those who don’t bother to ask the question will ever choose life at all.

随着世界变得越来越复杂，足智多谋的人越来越能继承未来。任何长时间想知道生命是否值得过的人都越来越可能得出这样的结论：这并不是因为诚实地思考这个问题非常困难。只有那些懒得问这个问题的人才会选择生活。

Of course, this is not to say resourceful people are superhuman. They’re not. The universe does not deign to always submit to relentlessly resourceful trial-and-error striving before even the apparently inexhaustible psychic resources run out. An overwhelming thing does not always stop being overwhelming just because you act like you’re unstoppable.

当然，这并不是说足智多谋的人就是超人。他们不是。即使看似取之不尽用之不竭的精神资源耗尽之前，宇宙也不会总是屈服于无情的、足智多谋的试错努力。一件压倒性的事情并不总是因为你表现得势不可挡而不再压倒性。

The universe is also full of strange impossibilities and constants. Even humans who act like perpetual motion machines eventually succumb to the second law of thermodynamics.

宇宙也充满了奇怪的不可能和常数。即使是像永动机一样运转的人类最终也会屈服于热力学第二定律。

But to a first approximation, there *is* such a thing as a resourceful life that is not worth examining. And it’s worth living that sort of life even if you’re only able to do it for one month out of every twelve.

但初步估计，足智多谋的生活是不值得审视的。即使你只能每十二个月中的一个月过这种生活，也是值得的。
