Most of us react to painful emotions in one of two ways:

我们大多数人都会以以下两种方式之一对痛苦的情绪做出反应：

1.  **Escape.** We try to avoid or outrun our difficult feelings by distracting ourselves—often with something like social media or food. At the extreme end of this strategy, some people are so hell-bent on avoiding difficult feelings that they keep themselves in a constant state of busyness (and stress) so that they never have a minute to be alone with their thoughts and feelings. This is one of the underlying causes of [burnout](https://nickwignall.com/burnout-at-work/) you rarely hear anyone talk about.
    
    逃脱。我们试图通过分散自己的注意力来避免或摆脱困难的感觉——通常是用社交媒体或食物之类的东西。在这种策略的极端情况下，有些人一心想要避免困难的感觉，以至于他们让自己一直处于忙碌（和压力）的状态，这样他们就没有时间独处，思考自己的想法和感受。这是你很少听到有人谈论的职业倦怠的根本原因之一。

2.  **Fix.** The other way we tend to react to difficult feelings is to try and fix them and make them go away. Maybe you immediately start telling yourself why it’s silly to feel the way you do—essentially trying to argue your way out of a painful feeling. Or maybe you go right to your “tool belt” of coping strategies and start deep breathing the second you feel anxious or irritated. Or perhaps your go-to fix-it strategy is reassurance-seeking—outsourcing your emotional struggles to someone else.
    
    使固定。我们对困难感受做出反应的另一种方式是尝试解决它们并让它们消失。也许你会立即开始告诉自己，为什么你这样的感受是愚蠢的——本质上是试图通过争论摆脱痛苦的感觉。或者，您可能会直接使用应对策略的“工具带”，并在感到焦虑或烦躁时开始深呼吸。或者，也许你的解决问题的首选策略是寻求安慰——将你的情感挣扎外包给其他人。

While these strategies of escape and fix “work” in the short term—i.e. they give some temporary relief—they make difficult emotions harder to manage in the long term.

虽然这些逃避和修复的策略在短期内“起作用”——即它们可以暂时缓解情绪，但从长远来看，它们会让困难的情绪更难控制。

And the reason is pretty straightforward:

原因很简单：

**When you constantly try to escape or eliminate your feelings, you teach your brain to see them as enemies.**

**当你不断地试图逃避或消除你的感受时，你就教会了你的大脑将它们视为敌人。**

And if your brain believes its own emotions are bad or dangerous, you’re going to start chronically feeling bad about feeling bad—anxious about feeling sad, angry about feeling anxious, guilty for feeling angry, etc.

如果你的大脑认为自己的情绪是不好的或危险的，你就会开始长期因为感觉不好而感到不好——因为感到悲伤而焦虑，因为感到焦虑而生气，因为感到生气而感到内疚等等。

The healthier way to manage difficult feelings is to change your relationship with them. Instead of treating painful emotions as enemies to be avoided or eliminated, you can learn to treat them as friends to be understood and accepted.

管理困难情绪的更健康方法是改变你与它们的关系。不要将痛苦的情绪视为需要避免或消除的敌人，你可以学会将它们视为需要理解和接受的朋友。

Here are 4 tips to get you started.

这里有 4 个帮助您入门的提示。

## 1\. Name it to tame it

1\. 给它命名来驯服它

A healthier relationship with your emotions begins with using better language to talk about them.

与情绪建立更健康的关系始于使用更好的语言来谈论它们。

Most people have developed an unconscious habit of [intellectualizing](https://nickwignall.com/intellectualized-emotions/) their emotions—using highly conceptual and vague language to talk about feelings rather than plain straightforward words.

大多数人都养成了一种无意识的习惯，将自己的情绪理性化——使用高度概念化和模糊的语言来谈论感受，而不是简单直白的语言。

For example: 例如：

-   Your partner forgets to take out the trash despite the fact that you’ve told them several times that you really need more help with household tasks.
    
    尽管您已经多次告诉您的伴侣您确实需要更多帮助做家务，但您的伴侣却忘记倒垃圾。

- They see that you’re upset and ask what’s wrong?
    
    他们看到你很沮丧并问你怎么了？

-   Instead of being honest and saying *I’m really angry right now* you intellectualize and say, *Nothing… I’m just stressed.*
    
    你不会诚实地说我现在真的很生气，你会理智地说，没什么……我只是压力很大。

There are two problems with this:

这样做有两个问题：

1.  *Stressed* is not an emotion. It’s a concept that includes a range of difficult experiences from thoughts and emotions to physical sensations.
    
    压力不是一种情绪。这个概念包括从思想、情感到身体感觉的一系列困难经历。

2.  *Stressed* is not an accurate description of how you feel. It’s a more socially acceptable way of describing feeling bad. But it’s not an accurate reflection of how you’re actually feeling.
    
    压力并不能准确描述您的感受。这是一种更容易被社会接受的描述糟糕感觉的方式。但这并不能准确反映您的实际感受。

Ironically, [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17576282/) shows that describing our emotions in plain, ordinary language actually helps to decrease their intensity.

讽刺的是，研究表明，用简单、普通的语言描述我们的情绪实际上有助于降低情绪的强度。

Which brings us to tip #1 for learning to live with difficult feelings instead of avoiding them:

这给我们带来了秘诀#1，学会忍受困难的感觉而不是逃避它们：

**Name it to tame it.**

**给它命名来驯服它。**

When you acknowledge how you’re feeling in plain, simple language, not only does it help reduce the intensity of the feeling, but it also teaches your brain a valuable lesson: emotions aren’t things to be hidden or covered up—they’re a normal, if uncomfortable, part of the human experience. And it’s normal and okay for me to feel them.

当你用简单明了的语言承认自己的感受时，不仅有助于降低感受的强度，而且还能给你的大脑上一堂宝贵的课：情绪不是需要隐藏或掩盖的东西——它们是“情绪”的一部分。这是人类经历的正常部分，尽管有些不舒服。对我来说，感觉到它们是正常的，也没什么问题。

## 2\. Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad

2\. 仅仅因为感觉不好并不意味着它不好

Imagine this: 想象一下：

-   You’re walking down the sidewalk and suddenly trip and fall.
    
    您沿着人行道行走，突然绊倒并跌倒。

-   As you try to stand up, you realize you can’t put any weight on your right arm because there’s a searing pain coming from your wrist.
    
    当你试图站起来时，你发现你的右臂无法承受任何重量，因为手腕传来灼热的疼痛。

-   As you inspect your wrists more carefully, you notice that it looks weird—like, it’s not aimed in the right direction.
    
    当你更仔细地检查你的手腕时，你会发现它看起来很奇怪——就像它没有瞄准正确的方向一样。

-   You also notice the throbbing pain in your wrist getting stronger.
    
    您还注意到手腕上的抽痛越来越强烈。

-   Then it dawns on you… you broke your wrist!
   
	然后你突然意识到……你的手腕骨折了！

Now, here’s the question (obviously a trick question given the overly dramatic build-up):

现在，这是一个问题（鉴于过于戏剧性的积累，显然这是一个棘手的问题）：

**Is the pain you feel in your wrist bad?**

**您的手腕疼痛严重吗？**

While it would be tempting to say of course it’s bad because it hurts so damn bad, when you stop and think about it, the answer is pretty clearly no, the pain of a broken wrist is not bad.

虽然人们很容易会说这当然很糟糕，因为它疼得厉害，但当你停下来想一想时，答案显然是否定的，手腕骨折的疼痛并不严重。

Of course, it hurts like hell. But that pain is actually a good thing: It’s your body’s way of signaling that there’s something very wrong with your wrist that should be corrected as soon as possible.

当然，痛得要命。但这种疼痛实际上是一件好事：这是你的身体发出信号的方式，表明你的手腕出现了严重问题，应该尽快纠正。

What’s bad is the broken bone. Pain is the messenger. And no matter how much you dislike the message, it’s not a good idea to shoot the messenger.

糟糕的是骨头断了。痛苦是使者。无论你多么不喜欢这条信息，开枪射杀信使都不是一个好主意。

**Just because pain feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad.**

**仅仅因为疼痛感觉很糟糕并不意味着它很糟糕。**

And the same is true for emotional pain.

对于情感上的痛苦也是如此。

For example: 例如：

-   Feeling anxious is uncomfortable but it’s not bad. You need fear to keep you safe. And even if your fear is occasionally misplaced, that doesn’t mean it’s bad (or you’re bad for feeling it).
    
    感到焦虑固然不舒服，但也不是坏事。你需要恐惧来保证你的安全。即使你的恐惧偶尔是错误的，这并不意味着它是坏的（或者你感觉它不好）。

-   Sadness is uncomfortable but it’s not bad. Sadness is a perfectly normal response to the loss of something valuable and helps us reflect on the things that matter most to us. It may well feel bad to feel sad, but that doesn’t mean it is bad (or you’re bad for feeling it).
    
    悲伤虽然令人不舒服，但并不坏。悲伤是对失去有价值的东西的一种完全正常的反应，可以帮助我们反思对我们最重要的事情。感到悲伤很可能会让人感觉不好，但这并不意味着它是不好的（或者你感到悲伤是不好的）。

-   Even an emotion like guilt isn’t actually bad. The feeling of guilt is one of the ways we remember to avoid doing the wrong thing in the future. Again… Just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad (or you’re bad for feeling it).
    
    即使是像内疚这样的情绪实际上也并不是坏事。内疚感是我们记住避免将来做错事的方法之一。再说一遍……仅仅因为感觉不好并不意味着它不好（或者你感觉不好）。

So, the next time you experience a difficult or painful emotion, try to remind yourself that *just because it feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad*.

所以，下次当你经历困难或痛苦的情绪时，试着提醒自己，感觉不好并不意味着它就是不好的。

## 3\. Be curious, not judgmental

3\. 保持好奇心，而不是评判性

Okay, so you’re hopefully nodding your head in agreement with my idea in the last point that just because an emotion feels bad doesn’t mean it is bad.

好吧，所以你希望你会点头同意我在最后一点中的想法，即仅仅因为一种情绪感觉不好并不意味着它是不好的。

But what do you do after you’ve acknowledged that it’s not bad to feel bad?

但是，当你承认感觉不好并不坏之后，你会做什么呢？

Well, the slightly cheeky but ultimately truest answer is…

好吧，有点厚颜无耻但最终最真实的答案是……

**You don’t have to do anything!**

**您无需执行任何操作！**

We’ve all been conditioned to think that we have to do something about difficult feelings because we believe that they’re bad. But once you accept the premise that just because it *feels* bad doesn’t mean it *is* bad, doing nothing becomes a perfectly valid (and actually very effective) method for handling difficult feelings.

我们都习惯于认为我们必须对困难的感觉采取一些措施，因为我们相信它们是不好的。但是，一旦你接受这样一个前提：感觉不好并不意味着它不好，那么什么都不做就成为处理困难情绪的完全有效（实际上非常有效）的方法。

Of course, it takes a fair amount of practice to get in the habit of acknowledging our difficult feelings honestly (instead of intellectualizing them), then reminding ourselves that even though they feel bad doesn’t mean they are bad, and then just letting them be while we go about our lives.

当然，需要大量的练习才能养成诚实地承认我们的困难感受（而不是将其理智化）的习惯，然后提醒自己，即使它们感觉不好并不意味着它们不好，然后就让它们发生当我们继续我们的生活时。

So, a helpful little tip I’ve found is that you can try to replace your instinct to be judgmental about how you’re feeling with the habit of being curious about it.

所以，我发现的一个有用的小技巧是，你可以尝试用好奇的习惯来取代对自己感受的判断本能。

For example: 例如：

-   Suppose you notice yourself getting increasingly irritated with your kids.
    
    假设您发现自己对孩子越来越恼火。

-   Your first reaction is to start getting judgmental with yourself for feeling irritated: *I need to relax! They’re just little kids. I shouldn’t have such a short fuse. I’m never going to have a good relationship with my kids if I’m always mad at them!*
    
    你的第一反应是开始因为感到恼怒而评判自己：我需要放松！他们只是小孩子。我不应该这么急躁。如果我总是生孩子的气，我永远不会和他们建立良好的关系！

-   Now, try to replace that judgmental self-talk with curiosity: *Yes, I am irritated and I’d rather not be, but there are probably some reasons why. They are being pretty obnoxious right now. Plus, today was really stressful at work, which is probably a big part of why I’m feeling more irritable than usual. Let me try and remember what sorts of things have helped in the past when I was feeling irritated with the kid… Oh yeah! Maybe we can all go for a walk to the park and get some of that energy out.*
    
    现在，尝试用好奇心取代这种评判性的自言自语：是的，我很恼火，我也不想生气，但可能有一些原因。他们现在非常令人讨厌。另外，今天的工作压力真的很大，这可能是我感觉比平时更烦躁的一个重要原因。让我试着回忆一下过去当我对这个孩子感到恼火时，哪些事情对我有帮助……哦，是的！也许我们都可以去公园散步，释放一些能量。

Judging yourself for feeling bad is understandable but totally counterproductive…

判断自己感觉不好是可以理解的，但完全适得其反……

**Feeling and about feeling bad only leads to feeling worse.**

**感觉不好或者关于感觉不好只会导致感觉更糟。**

If you can start to cultivate a habit of being curious about difficult feelings, rather than judgmental, not only will those feelings subside more quickly, you’ll also be fostering a much kinder, gentler relationship with your own mind.

如果你能开始养成一种习惯，对困难的感受感到好奇，而不是做出评判，那么这些感受不仅会消退得更快，你也会与自己的思想建立一种更友善、更温和的关系。

## 4\. Practice with small emotions

4、用小情绪来练习

Suppose you wanted to run a marathon. Would it make sense to just lace up your sneakers and try to run for 26.2 miles? Of course not!

假设你想跑马拉松。系上运动鞋的鞋带并尝试跑 26.2 英里是否有意义？当然不是！

If you want to do something challenging like run a marathon you have to train for it. And that means starting with running a couple miles and slowly building your way up.

如果你想做一些有挑战性的事情，比如跑马拉松，你就必须进行训练。这意味着从跑几英里开始，然后慢慢向上。

Or suppose you want to be able to play guitar like Jimi Hendrix. Would it make sense to pick up a guitar and just start trying to play the solo from All Along the Watchtower? Obviously not!

或者假设您希望能够像吉米·亨德里克斯那样弹吉他。拿起吉他并开始尝试弹奏《All Below the Watchtower》中的独奏是否有意义？很明显不是！

If you have any hopes of playing guitar at all like Jimi Hendrix you’re going to have to practice first. And that means practicing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star or something easier for a while and gradually working your way up.

如果您希望像吉米·亨德里克斯那样弹吉他，那么您必须先练习。这意味着练习一闪一闪亮晶晶小星星或一些更简单的东西一段时间，然后逐渐提高。

Well, the same principle applies to dealing with difficult emotions…

嗯，同样的原则也适用于处理困难的情绪……

**You can’t just expect to be an expert at managing hugely painful emotions if you haven’t practiced.**

**如果你没有练习过，你就不能指望成为管理极度痛苦情绪的专家。**

And the best way to practice is to start small and work your way up.

最好的练习方法就是从小事做起，逐步提高。

For example: 例如：

-   Let’s say you struggle with [social anxiety](https://nickwignall.com/social-anxiety/).
    
    假设您正在与社交焦虑作斗争。

-   And the thing your social anxiety is really holding you back from is making new friends.
    
    社交焦虑真正阻碍你的是结交新朋友。

-   But striking up conversations with brand new people is just about the scariest thing you can imagine doing.
    
    但与全新的人交谈可能是你能想象到的最可怕的事情。

-   Instead of trying to brute force your way through conversations with new people, practice on smaller easier situations first.
    
    与其尝试用蛮力与新人交谈，不如先在更小、更容易的情况下练习。

-   Maybe you practice having casual chit-chat with some coworkers who you’re familiar with but don’t actually talk about non-work stuff with very often.
    
    也许你练习与一些你熟悉的同事随意闲聊，但实际上并不经常谈论与工作无关的事情。

-   Then, once you feel a little more confident, try initiating conversations with waiters and waitresses or checkout clerks at the store—new people but where the stakes are lower.
   
	然后，一旦你感觉更有信心了，就可以尝试与商店里的男女服务员或收银员进行对话——他们是新人，但风险较低。

See the pattern? 

看到图案了吗？

Getting better at dealing with big, painful emotions is a skill like anything else. Which means it makes sense to practice in a similar way as you do any other skill in life: Start small and slowly work your way up as you gain both competence and confidence.

更好地处理巨大、痛苦的情绪是一种像其他任何事情一样的技能。这意味着以与生活中任何其他技能类似的方式进行练习是有意义的：从小事做起，慢慢地提高你的能力和信心。

Not only with this help you get better at managing whatever difficult emotion it is you struggle with, but it will also help cultivate a healthier relationship with difficult emotions generally.

这不仅可以帮助您更好地管理您所挣扎的任何困难情绪，而且还有助于与困难情绪建立更健康的关系。

Because when your mind sees you habitually approaching, rather than avoiding, difficult feelings, it stops viewing them as threats and dangers.

因为当你的大脑看到你习惯性地接近而不是回避困难的感觉时，它就会不再将它们视为威胁和危险。

And in the long run, that’s where true emotional strength comes from—learning to be compassionate, not combative, with our feelings.

从长远来看，这就是真正的情感力量的来源——学会对我们的感受充满同情心，而不是好斗。
