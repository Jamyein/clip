Why do some people always seem so calm and zen-like while the rest of us seem to be constantly frantic, stressed, and overwhelmed?

为什么有些人总是显得如此平静和禅宗，而我们其他人却似乎总是处于疯狂、压力和不知所措的状态？

Of course, everything from your current life stressors to your genetics probably plays some role in how calm or crazy you feel on a regular basis. But here’s the thing a lot of people don’t realize:

当然，从你当前的生活压力源到你的遗传因素，一切因素都可能会影响你平时的平静或疯狂程度。但很多人没有意识到这一点：

**You can create a calmer mind by building better habits.**

**您可以通过养成更好的习惯来让头脑更加平静。**

Whether through deliberate planning or dumb luck, consistently calm people have cultivated habits that help to keep them feeling calm even when things get stressful and chaotic.

无论是经过深思熟虑的计划还是运气不好，一贯冷静的人都养成了习惯，即使在事情变得充满压力和混乱时，也能帮助他们保持冷静。

If you want to become a calmer person, try to cultivate these 6 habits.

如果你想成为一个冷静的人，试着培养这6个习惯。

## 1\. They keep their expectations in check

1.他们控制自己的期望

*Expectations are often subtle defense mechanisms against the fear of uncertainty and helplessness.*

*期望往往是针对不确定性和无助恐惧的微妙防御机制。*

When you can’t actually control an external situation—or are too afraid to try—retreating into your own mind and telling yourself stories about how things *should be* gives the illusion of control.

当你无法真正控制外部情况时，或者太害怕而不敢尝试时，退回到自己的想法中，给自己讲一些关于事情应该如何发展的故事，会给你一种控制的错觉。

For example: 例如：

-   Suppose you have a boss who isn’t very supportive of you, especially during team meetings. You’ve asked him several times to be more supportive but nothing changes.
    假设你的老板不太支持你，尤其是在团队会议期间。你已经多次要求他给予更多支持，但一切都没有改变。
-   So you’ve gotten in the habit of telling yourself stories about how he *should* be supportive—and how that’s what good bosses do. And you do this because it temporarily gives you something to do that *feels* productive—like you can control things.
    所以你已经养成了给自己讲故事的习惯，告诉自己他应该如何支持——以及好老板是如何做到的。你这样做是因为它可以暂时让你做一些让你感觉富有成效的事情——就像你可以控制事情一样。
-   Of course, in the long run, these expectations are unrealistic and will continue to get violated, leading to a steady stream of disappointment, frustration, and decidedly non-calm moods and mindsets.
    当然，从长远来看，这些期望是不切实际的，并且会不断被违背，从而导致源源不断的失望、沮丧和明显不平静的情绪和心态。

**Expectations give us the illusion of control in the short term. But in the long term, all they do is stress us out.**

**期望给我们一种短期内可以控制的错觉。但从长远来看，他们所做的只是给我们带来压力。**

People who keep a calm mind know that the long-term stress of high expectations isn’t worth the short term-relief they bring.

保持冷静头脑的人知道，高期望带来的长期压力不值得它们带来的短期缓解。

So if you want to foster more inner calm and peace of mind, train yourself to be skeptical of your own expectations and stories of how things *should* be and stay focused on how things really *are*.

因此，如果你想培养更多内心的平静和平静，训练自己对自己的期望和事情应该如何的故事持怀疑态度，并专注于事情的真实情况。

## 2\. They take responsibility for their actions, not outcomes

2\. 他们对自己的行为而不是结果负责

There are very few things in life where you have *total* control over the outcome:

生活中很少有事情是你可以完全控制结果的：

-   No matter how good a parent you are, your kid may still struggle or screw up sometimes.
    
    无论您是多么好的父母，您的孩子有时仍然可能会挣扎或搞砸。

-   No matter how hard you study, there may be questions you couldn’t anticipate and get wrong.
    
    无论你多么努力地学习，都可能会出现一些你无法预料并出错的问题。

-   No matter how carefully you craft your pitch, you can’t fully control how potential clients will react to it.
    
    无论您如何精心设计推销内容，您都无法完全控制潜在客户对此的反应。

Unfortunately, facing up to this reality means feeling helpless. And some people simply can’t stand feeling helpless—like they can’t fully control things.

不幸的是，面对这个现实意味着感到无助。有些人就是无法忍受无助感——就像他们无法完全控制事情一样。

As a result, they tell themselves they should be able to control how things turn out and then *inevitably* get frustrated, stressed out, and disappointed when things don’t go exactly to plan.

结果，他们告诉自己，他们应该能够控制事情的结果，然后当事情没有完全按计划进行时，他们不可避免地会感到沮丧、压力和失望。

**If you hold yourself responsible for things you can’t control, you’re setting yourself up for stress and disappointment.**

**如果你让自己对无法控制的事情负责，你就会给自己带来压力和失望。**

Remarkably calm people avoid taking full responsibility for outcomes because they know that the only thing they have anything close to full control over is their actions:

非常冷静的人避免对结果承担全部责任，因为他们知道他们唯一可以完全控制的就是他们的行为：

-   You’re responsible for doing your best by your children, not for how they turn out as human beings.
    
    你有责任为你的孩子尽力而为，而不是他们作为人的表现。

-   You’re responsible for how well you study, not for whether you got a B+ or an A-.
   
	你要对你的学习成绩负责，而不是对你是 B+ 还是 A- 负责。

-   You’re responsible for the effort you put into creating a great pitch, no for other people’s reactions to it.
   
	你要对你为创造一个伟大的宣传所付出的努力负责，而不是其他人对此的反应。

Now, I know this all might sound a little radical at first, but I’d encourage you to reflect on it a little more deeply.

现在，我知道这一切一开始可能听起来有点激进，但我鼓励你更深入地反思一下。

**Your sense of responsibility should not exceed your capacity for control.**

**你的责任感不应该超出你的控制能力。**

Get in the habit of taking responsibility for your actions and let the outcomes be what they will.

养成对自己的行为负责的习惯，让结果如其所愿。

## 3\. They embrace JOMO: The Joy of Missing Out

3\. 他们拥抱JOMO：错过的喜悦

You’ve probably heard of FOMO, the Fear of Missing Out…

您可能听说过 FOMO，即害怕错过……

-   Even though you’re exhausted and have a big day tomorrow, you say yes to your friend’s invitation to go out drinking because you’re afraid you might miss out on a really fun evening.
    
    尽管你已经筋疲力尽，明天又是一个重要的日子，但你还是答应了朋友出去喝酒的邀请，因为你担心自己可能会错过一个非常有趣的夜晚。

-   Even though you committed to cooking all your own meals this week and working on your diet, you agree to go out to dinner with your sister because it’s the grand opening of a super cool new restaurant and could be AMAZING!
    
    尽管您承诺本周自己做饭并控制饮食，但您还是同意与姐姐一起出去吃饭，因为这是一家超级酷的新餐厅的盛大开业，而且可能会很棒！


The problem with FOMO—the fear of missing out—is that because you’re afraid to miss out on immediate experiences, you end up sacrificing long-term commitments like getting good sleep and performing well at work or sticking to a healthy diet.

FOMO（害怕错过）的问题在于，因为你害怕错过眼前的经历，你最终会牺牲长期的承诺，比如良好的睡眠、良好的工作表现或坚持健康的饮食。

Of course, that doesn’t mean you should never accept spontaneous invitations! But it’s very easy to get in the habit of always indulging FOMO. And when you do, your [long-term values](https://nickwignall.com/know-your-values/), commitments, health, and peace of mind usually suffer.

当然，这并不意味着您永远不应该接受自发的邀请！但很容易养成总是沉迷于 FOMO 的习惯。当你这样做时，你的长期价值观、承诺、健康和内心的平静通常都会受到影响。

Remarkably calm people deal with FOMO head on by embracing JOMO, the Joy of Missing Out.

非常冷静的人会通过拥抱 JOMO（“错过的喜悦”）来应对 FOMO。

Embracing the joy of missing out simply means that you remind yourself that even though you might well be missing out on something enjoyable or exciting now, you’re gaining something far greater: The long-term joy that comes from keeping promises to yourself, taking care of your health and wellbeing, and being free to make decisions based on your values rather than passing whims or fears.

拥抱错过的喜悦仅仅意味着你提醒自己，即使你现在很可能错过一些令人愉快或令人兴奋的事情，但你正在获得更大的东西：长期的快乐来自于信守对自己的承诺，接受自己的承诺。照顾您的健康和福祉，并根据您的价值观自由做出决定，而不是一时兴起或恐惧。

**Truly calm people are in the habit of making decisions based on their long-term values and wellbeing, not passing impulses and insecurities.**

*真正冷静的人习惯于根据自己的长期价值观和福祉做出决定，而不是传递冲动和不安全感。**

Embrace the joy of missing out and you’ll enjoy the benefits of long-term satisfaction and peace of mind.

拥抱错过的喜悦，您将享受长期满足感和内心平静的好处。

## 4\. They set healthy boundaries

4.他们设定健康的界限

People who are constantly stressed out and worried often have very poor boundaries:

经常感到压力和忧虑的人的界限往往很薄弱：

-   They feel uncomfortable saying no to people and end up taking on way too much work and responsibility.
    
    他们对拒绝别人感到不自在，最终承担了太多的工作和责任。

-   They get insecure about disappointing their friends, so they say yes to everything—even if it’s stuff they don’t really want to do.
    
    他们因为让朋友失望而感到不安全，所以他们对一切都说“是”——即使是他们并不真正想做的事情。

-   Their primary source of [self-esteem](https://nickwignall.com/ignore-self-esteem-self-efficacy/) comes from external validation, so they’re afraid to stick up for what they want for fear of losing that validation from others.
    
    他们的自尊的主要来源来自外部认可，因此他们害怕坚持自己想要的东西，因为害怕失去别人的认可。

**Having no boundaries means taking on everyone else’s problems and stresses as your own—so of course you never feel calm!**

**没有界限意味着要把别人的问题和压力当作自己的问题和压力——所以你当然永远不会感到平静！**

The trick is to build up your tolerance to your fear of disappointing others.

诀窍是增强你对让别人失望的恐惧的容忍度。

Because if you do start saying no and setting better boundaries, people will get upset and disappointed (although probably not to the degree you’re fearing). And it will be uncomfortable… temporarily.

因为如果你确实开始说不并设定更好的界限，人们会感到不安和失望（尽管可能没有达到你担心的程度）。而且会暂时感到不舒服。

But the long-term benefits to your wellbeing and peace of mind will be profound:

但对您的健康和内心平静的长期好处将是深远的：

**Imagine how much calmer your life would be if you only had to worry about your issues instead of everyone else’s too?**

**想象一下，如果您只需要担心自己的问题而不是其他人的问题，您的生活会平静多少？**

Remarkably calm people understand that you can’t really be helpful to others if you don’t take care of yourself first. And more often than not, that means [setting (and enforcing!) healthy boundaries](https://nickwignall.com/assertiveness/).

非常冷静的人明白，如果你不先照顾好自己，你就无法真正帮助别人。通常，这意味着设定（并强制执行！）健康的界限。

## 5\. They control their thoughts, not their feelings

5\. 他们控制自己的想法，而不是自己的感受

Trying to control your feelings is a recipe for chronic stress and frustration because fundamentally, you can’t.

试图控制自己的感受会导致长期压力和沮丧，因为从根本上来说，你做不到。

You don’t have direct control over any of your emotions:

您无法直接控制自己的任何情绪：

-   You can’t just crank up the happiness dial any time you feel sad.
    
    你不能在感到悲伤的时候就调高幸福度。

-   You can’t adjust the [anxiety](https://nickwignall.com/anxiety-myths/) knob a little lower at then magically feel more confident.
    
    你无法将焦虑旋钮调低一点，然后神奇地感到更加自信。

-   You can’t pull the anger emergency brake and instantly feel tranquil and calm.
    
    你无法拉下愤怒紧急刹车并立即感到平静和平静。

But it’s worse… Not only is it not possible to directly control how you feel, but trying to control your feelings usually leads to feeling worse:

但更糟糕的是……不仅不可能直接控制你的感受，而且试图控制你的感受通常会导致感觉更糟：

-   Trying to make yourself feel happy (and failing) leads to more disappointment and unhappiness.
    
    试图让自己感到快乐（和失败）会导致更多的失望和不快乐。

-   Trying to make yourself feel less anxious often leads to dealing anxious about feeling anxious.
    
    试图让自己不那么焦虑常常会导致因焦虑而焦虑。

-   Trying to will your way out of [feeling angry](https://nickwignall.com/secret-life-of-anger/) (and failing) usually just leads to more frustration and self-directed anger.
    
    试图用自己的方式摆脱愤怒（和失败）通常只会导致更多的挫败感和自我导向的愤怒。

**Trying to control the uncontrollable—including your emotions—will always lead to a more stressful mind, not a calmer one.**

**试图控制无法控制的事情——包括你的情绪——总是会导致你的心情更加紧张，而不是更加平静。**

If you want to change how you feel emotionally, you can only do it *indirectly* by changing how you think:

如果你想改变你的情绪感受，你只能通过改变你的想法来间接做到：

-   When you’re feeling sad, you can [validate your sadness](https://nickwignall.com/scheduled-sadness/) by reminding yourself that everybody feels sad sometimes. And that just because it *feels* bad to be sad doesn’t mean it *is* bad to be sad.
    
    当你感到悲伤时，你可以通过提醒自己每个人有时都会感到悲伤来验证你的悲伤。仅仅因为悲伤感觉不好并不意味着悲伤是不好的。

-   When you’re feeling anxious, you can shift your attention out of worrying more about the future and redirect your thoughts to something productive.
    
    当您感到焦虑时，您可以将注意力从对未来的担忧中转移出来，并将您的想法转移到富有成效的事情上。

-   When you’re feeling angry, you can tell yourself that it’s okay to feel angry so long as you control how you respond to that anger.
    
    当您感到生气时，您可以告诉自己，只要您控制对愤怒的反应，感到生气就可以。

**If you want a calmer mind, you need a better relationship with your emotions.**

**如果你想要一个更平静的头脑，你需要与你的情绪建立更好的关系。**

And a major part of cultivating a healthy relationship with your emotions is not trying to control them directly. The best you can do is manage your thoughts and behaviors and allow your feelings to be what they are however uncomfortable.

与情绪建立健康的关系的一个主要部分不是试图直接控制它们。你能做的最好的事情就是管理你的想法和行为，让你的感受随心所欲，无论多么不舒服。

## 6\. They surround themselves with supportive people

6.他们周围都是支持者

It’s a cliche, but a true one: human beings are social creatures.

这是一句陈词滥调，却是千真万确的：人类是社会性动物。

And one of the implications of this is that no matter how much self-work you do on your own “stuff,” other people will always influence your mental state:

其含义之一是，无论你在自己的“东西”上做了多少自我工作，其他人总是会影响你的精神状态：

-   You can do mindfulness exercises all day long, but a micromanaging supervisor at work is still going to cause a lot of stress and mental chaos.
    
    你可以整天进行正念练习，但工作中的微观管理主管仍然会造成很大的压力和精神混乱。

-   You can work incredibly hard to change your [negative self-talk](https://nickwignall.com/negative-self-talk/), but if you live with a partner who’s cruel, demeaning, or abusive, peace of mind is going to be tough to come by.
    
    你可以非常努力地改变你消极的自言自语，但如果你和一个残忍、贬低或辱骂的伴侣住在一起，你就很难获得内心的平静。

The point is simply this:

要点很简单：

**The people you spend time with on a regular basis will have a profound effect on how calm you feel.**

**经常与您相处的人会对您的平静程度产生深远的影响。**

Which means that ultimately, to find more peace of mind, you may need to make some serious changes to your social life and relationships.

这意味着最终，为了找到更多内心的平静，您可能需要对您的社交生活和人际关系做出一些重大改变。

And while it’s often quite challenging, consistently calm people have often done the hard work to limit their exposure to stress-inducing people. But more than that, they proactively cultivate relationships that are supportive.

虽然这通常很有挑战性，但始终保持冷静的人通常会付出艰苦的努力来限制自己与会产生压力的人接触。但更重要的是，他们主动培养支持性的关系。

Because when you surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you, that you genuinely enjoy spending time with, and who willingly support you when times are tough, peace of mind is something that grows naturally, not something you have to constantly fight for.

因为当你周围都是真正关心你、真正喜欢与你共度时光、在困难时愿意支持你的人时，内心的平静就会自然而然地增长，而不是你必须不断地争取的东西。

Of course, all this is *way* easier said than done!

当然，这一切说起来容易做起来难！

But you have to at least acknowledge how important your relationships are for your mental peace and wellbeing if you stand any chance of cultivating it.

但如果你有机会培养人际关系，你至少必须承认你的人际关系对于你的精神平静和幸福有多么重要。
