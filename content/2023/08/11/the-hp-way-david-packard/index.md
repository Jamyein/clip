  original_title: "The HP Way: Dave Packard on How to Operate a Company"
  original_lang: en-US
---

In 1960, David Packard gave an informal speech that wasn’t originally intended for publication. In fact the speech only surfaced again during the debate over the merger between Hewlett Packard and Compaq. At the time the leadership of HP portrayed themselves as doing exactly “what Dave Packard would have done.”

1960 年，大卫·帕卡德 (David Packard) 发表了一次非正式演讲，该演讲最初并不打算发表。事实上，这段言论只是在惠普与康柏合并的争论中才再次浮出水面。当时，惠普的领导层将自己描述为“戴夫·帕卡德会做的事”。

As a rebuttal to this dubious use of language, David Packard Jr. published a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal (March 15, 2002) reprinting a wonderful speech his father gave in the ’60s to a group of HP managers. Nothing could be better evidence of the philosophy than the words, delivered on the job from his father.

为了反驳这种可疑的语言使用，小戴维·帕卡德 (David Packard Jr.) 在《华尔街日报》（2002 年 3 月 15 日）上刊登了整版广告，转载了他父亲在 60 年代向一群惠普经理发表的精彩演讲。没有什么比他父亲在工作中所说的话更能证明这一哲学了。

The speech, which can be found in [The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060845791/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060845791&linkCode=as2&tag=noisefreeinve-20&linkId=VOLVABWFZXTOASDB), dealt with a number of subjects including why a company exists, the difference between management by objective and management by control, how to manage people, the importance of financial responsibility and more.

这篇演讲可以在《惠普之道：比尔·休利特和我如何建立我们的公司》中找到，讨论了许多主题，包括公司为何存在、目标管理与控制管理之间的区别、如何管理人员、财务责任的重要性等等。

Packard opens his speech by saying “I think this is going to be crucial in determining whether we are able to continue to grow and keep an efficient organization and maintain the character of our company”.

帕卡德在演讲开始时说道：“我认为这对于决定我们是否能够继续发展、保持高效的组织以及保持我们公司的特色至关重要”。

When discussing **why a company exists** in the first place, Packard writes:

在讨论公司存在的初衷时，帕卡德写道：

> I think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money. While this is an important result of a company’s existence, we have to go deeper and find the real reasons for our being. As we investigate this, we inevitably come to the conclusion that a group of people get together and exist as an institution that we call a company so they are able to accomplish something collectively which they could not accomplish separately. They are able to do something worthwhile— they make a contribution to society (a phrase which sounds trite but is fundamental).
> 
> 我认为许多人错误地认为公司的存在只是为了赚钱。虽然这是一个公司存在的重要结果，但我们必须更深入地寻找我们存在的真正原因。当我们对此进行调查时，我们不可避免地得出这样的结论：一群人聚集在一起，作为一个我们称之为公司的机构而存在，这样他们就能够共同完成一些他们单独无法完成的事情。他们能够做一些有价值的事情——他们为社会做出贡献（这句话听起来很老套，但却是基本的）。
>
> \[…\] \[…\]
>
> So with that in mind let us discuss why the Hewlett-Packard Company exists. I think it is obvious that we started this company because Bill and I, and some of those working with us in the early days, felt that we were able to design and make instruments which were not as yet available. I believe that our company has grown over the years for that very reason. Working together we have been able to provide for the technical people, our customers, things which are better than they were able to get anywhere else. The real reason for our existence is that we provide something which is unique. Our particular area of contribution is to design, develop, and manufacture electronic measuring instruments.
> 
> 因此，考虑到这一点，让我们讨论一下惠普公司存在的原因。我认为很明显，我们创办这家公司是因为比尔和我，以及一些早期与我们合作的人，认为我们能够设计和制造目前尚不可用的仪器。我相信正是因为这个原因，我们公司多年来一直在发展。通过共同努力，我们能够为技术人员、我们的客户提供比他们在其他地方所能得到的更好的东西。我们存在的真正原因是我们提供独特的东西。我们的具体贡献领域是设计、开发和制造电子测量仪器。
>
> …
>
> \[T\]he reason for our existence and the measure of our success is how well we are able to make our product.
> 我们存在的理由和衡量我们成功的标准是我们生产产品的能力。

As for how the individual person fits into these efforts, Packard hits on **the difference between management by objective and management by control**:

至于个人如何适应这些努力，帕卡德谈到了目标管理和控制管理之间的区别：

> The individual works, partly to make money, of course, but we should also realize that the individual who is doing a worthwhile job is working because he feels he is accomplishing something worthwhile. This is important in your association with these individuals. You know that those people you work with that are working only for money are not making any real contribution. I want to emphasize then that people work to make a contribution and they do this best when they have a real objective when they know what they are trying to achieve and are able to use their own capabilities to the greatest extent. This is a basic philosophy which we have discussed before— Management by Objective as compared to Management by Control.
> 
> 当然，个人工作部分是为了赚钱，但我们也应该认识到，做有价值工作的个人之所以工作，是因为他觉得自己正在完成一些有价值的事情。这对于您与这些人的交往非常重要。你知道那些和你一起工作的人只是为了钱而工作，并没有做出任何真正的贡献。我想强调的是，人们工作是为了做出贡献，当他们有真正的目标、知道自己想要实现什么并能够最大程度地利用自己的能力时，他们会做得最好。这是我们之前讨论过的基本理念——目标管理与控制管理的比较。

\*\*\*

Continuing, Packard hits on the notion of **what it means to supervise someone**:

帕卡德接着谈到了监督某人的含义：

> In other words when we discuss supervision and management we are not talking about a military type organization where the man at the top issues an order and it is passed on down the line until the man at the bottom does as he is told without question (or reason). That is precisely the type of organization we do not want. We feel our objectives can best be achieved by people who understand what they are trying to do and can utilize their own capabilities to do them. I have noticed when we promote people from a routine job to a supervisory position, there is a tremendous likelihood that these people will get carried away by the authority. They figure that all they have to do now is tell everyone else what to do and quite often this attitude causes trouble. We must realize that supervision is not a job of giving orders; it is a job of providing the opportunity for people to use their capabilities efficiently and effectively. I don’t mean you are not to give orders. I mean that what you are trying to get is something else. One of the underlying requirements of this sort of approach is that we do understand a little more specifically what the objectives of the company are. These then have to be translated into the objectives of the departments and groups and so on down.
> 
> 换句话说，当我们讨论监督和管理时，我们并不是在谈论军事型组织，在这种组织中，高层发出命令，命令会向下传递，直到底层的人毫无疑问地按照指示去做（或者原因）。这正是我们不想要的组织类型。我们认为，只有了解自己想要做什么并能够利用自己的能力来实现这些目标的人才能最好地实现我们的目标。我注意到，当我们将人们从日常工作提拔到主管职位时，这些人很可能会被权威冲昏头脑。他们认为现在他们所要做的就是告诉其他人该做什么，而这种态度常常会带来麻烦。我们必须认识到，监督不是发号施令，而是发号施令。这是一项为人们提供有效利用其能力的机会的工作。我并不是说你不可以发号施令。我的意思是，你想要得到的是别的东西。这种方法的基本要求之一是我们确实更具体地了解公司的目标是什么。然后这些必须转化为部门和小组的目标等等。

\*\*\*

While Steve Jobs famously said that focus is the ability to say no, **Packard approached focus from another angle**:

虽然史蒂夫·乔布斯有句名言，专注就是说不的能力，但帕卡德却从另一个角度看待专注：

> The other objective which is complementary to this and equally important is to try to make everything we do worthwhile. We want to do our best when we take on a job. … The logical result of this is that as we concentrate our efforts on these areas and are able to find better ways to do the job, we will logically, develop a better line of general purpose measuring instruments.
> 
> 与此相补充且同样重要的另一个目标是努力使我们所做的一切都有价值。当我们接受一份工作时，我们希望尽力而为。 ......这样做的逻辑结果是，当我们将精力集中在这些领域并能够找到更好的方法来完成工作时，我们将顺理成章地开发出更好的通用测量仪器系列。

**Getting the product to the customer is only half the job**.

将产品交付给客户只是工作的一半。

> In engineering, there are two basic criteria that are uppermost in the definition of what we hope to be able to do. As we develop these new instruments, we hope they will be creative in their design, and they will provide better ways of doing a job. There are many examples of this— the instruments our engineers have developed this last year give us some good examples. The clip-on milliammeter, the new wave analyzer, the sampling scope— all are really creative designs. They give people who buy them methods of making measurements they could not make before those instruments were available. However, creative design alone is not enough and never will be. In order to make these into useful devices, there must be meticulous attention to detail. The engineers understand this. They get an instrument to the place where it is about ready to go and the job is about half done. The same applies in the manufacturing end of the program. We need to produce efficiently in order to achieve our slogan of inexpensive quality. Cost is a very important part of the objective in manufacturing, but producing an instrument in the quickest manner is not satisfactory unless at the same time every detail is right. Attention to detail is as important in manufacturing as it is in engineering.
> 
> 在工程学中，有两个基本标准是定义我们希望能够做什么的最重要的标准。当我们开发这些新仪器时，我们希望它们在设计上具有创造性，并提供更好的工作方式。这方面的例子有很多——我们的工程师去年开发的仪器给我们提供了一些很好的例子。夹式毫安表、新型波形分析仪、采样示波器——所有这些都是真正的创意设计。它们为购买者提供了在这些仪器出现之前无法进行的测量方法。然而，仅靠创意设计是不够的，而且永远也不够。为了将它们变成有用的设备，必须对细节一丝不苟。工程师们明白这一点。他们将仪器送到即将准备就绪的地方，工作大约完成了一半。这同样适用于程序的制造端。我们需要高效生产，以实现物美价廉的口号。成本是制造目标中非常重要的一部分，但以最快的方式生产仪器并不令人满意，除非同时每个细节都正确。注重细节在制造中与工程中同样重要。

\*\*\*

It’s not about what you sell, it’s about **the problems you solve**.

重要的不是你卖什么，而是你解决的问题。

> We certainly are not anxious to sell a customer something he does not want, nor need. You may laugh, but this has happened— in other companies of course, not ours! Also, we want to be sure that when the instrument is delivered, it performs the function the customer wanted.
> 
> 我们当然不急于向客户出售他不想要或不需要的东西。你可能会笑，但这已经发生过——当然是在其他公司，不是我们的公司！此外，我们希望确保仪器交付时能够执行客户想要的功能。

\*\*\*

Packard, ever the financial conservative, offers **a timeless lesson on financial responsibility**:

帕卡德作为一名金融保守派，在财务责任方面提供了永恒的教训：

> Financial responsibility is equally important, however different in nature. It is essentially a service function to see that we generate the resources which make it possible for us all to do our job.
> 
> 财务责任同样重要，但性质不同。它本质上是一种服务功能，旨在帮助我们生成资源，使我们所有人都能完成我们的工作。
>
> These things translated mean that in addition to having the objective of trying to make a contribution to our customers, we must consider our responsibilities in a broader sense. If our main thought is to make money, we won’t care about these details. If we don’t care about the details, we won’t make as much money. They go hand in hand.
> 
> 这些翻译意味着，除了努力为客户做出贡献的目标之外，我们还必须在更广泛的意义上考虑我们的责任。如果我们的主要想法是赚钱，我们就不会关心这些细节。如果我们不关心细节，我们就赚不到那么多钱。他们齐头并进。

\*\*\*

On the company’s responsibility to employees:

关于公司对员工的责任：

> We are not interested only in making a better product. We feel that in asking you people to work for us, we in turn have an obligation. This is an important point and one which we ask each of you to relay to all the employees. Our first obligation, which is self-evident from my previous remarks, is to let people know they are doing something worthwhile. We must provide a means of letting our employees know they have done a good job. You as supervisors must convey this to your groups. Don’t just give orders. Provide the opportunity for your people to do something important. Encourage them.
> 
> 我们不仅仅对制造更好的产品感兴趣。我们认为，要求你们为我们工作，我们也有义务。这是很重要的一点，我们要求你们每一个人向所有员工传达这一点。从我之前的言论来看，我们的首要义务是不言而喻的，那就是让人们知道他们正在做一些有价值的事情。我们必须提供一种方法让我们的员工知道他们做得很好。作为主管，您必须将这一点传达给您的团队。不要只是发号施令。为您的员工提供做重要事情的机会。鼓励他们。

\*\*\*

On the contentious question of whether **a manager needs to understand the realities of their people,** Packard offers a clear rebuttal of the argument that management skills are sufficient.

关于管理者是否需要了解员工的现实这一有争议的问题，帕卡德明确反驳了“管理技能就足够了”的论点。

> Some say you can be a good manager without having the slightest idea of what you are trying to manage, that the techniques of management are all important. There are many organizations which work that way. I don’t argue that the job can’t be done that way but I do argue strongly that the best job can be done when the manager or supervisor has a real and genuine understanding of his group’s work. … I don’t see how a person can even understand what proper standards are and what performance is required unless he does understand in some detail the very specific nature of the work he is trying to supervise.
> 
> 有人说，你可以成为一名优秀的管理者，而无需对自己要管理的内容一无所知，管理技术非常重要。有许多组织都是这样运作的。我并不认为这项工作不能以这种方式完成，但我确实强烈认为，当经理或主管对其团队的工作有真正的了解时，才能完成最好的工作。 ……我不明白一个人如何能够理解什么是正确的标准以及需要什么绩效，除非他确实详细地了解了他试图监督的工作的具体性质。

\*\*\*

As to **what traits management should exhibit** …

至于管理应该表现出什么特征……

> Tolerance is tremendously significant. Unless you are tolerant of the people under you, you really can’t do a good job of being a supervisor. You must have understanding— understanding of the little things that affect people. You must have a sense of fairness, and you must know what it is reasonable to expect of your people. You must have a good set of standards for your group but you must maintain these standards with fairness and understanding.
> 
> 宽容是非常重要的。除非你能包容下属，否则你真的不能做好主管。你必须有理解——理解影响人们的小事情。你必须有公平感，并且你必须知道对你的员工有什么合理的期望。您必须为您的团队制定一套良好的标准，但您必须以公平和理解的方式维护这些标准。

\*\*\*

Lest you think Packard was a socialist, he argues that **profits are the only path** towards achieving the management philosophy he laid out.

为了避免您认为帕卡德是社会主义者，他认为利润是实现他所阐述的管理哲学的唯一途径。

> I want to say that I have mentioned our primary objectives, but none of these can be accomplished unless the company makes a profit. Profit is the measure of our contribution to our customers— it is a measure of what our customers are willing to pay us over and above the actual cost of an instrument. Only to the extent that we can do something worthwhile, can provide more for the customer, will he year in and year out pay us enough so we have something left over. So profit is the measure of how well we work together. It is really the final measure because, if we cannot do these things so the customer will pay us, our work is futile.
> 
> 我想说的是，我已经提到了我们的首要目标，但如果公司不盈利，这些目标都无法实现。利润是我们对客户贡献的衡量标准——它衡量的是我们的客户愿意支付我们超出仪器实际成本的费用。只有我们能做一些有价值的事情，能为客户提供更多的东西，他才会年复一年地付给我们足够的钱，这样我们才有剩余。因此，利润是衡量我们合作程度的标准。这确实是最后的措施，因为如果我们不能做这些事情让客户付钱给我们，我们的工作就是徒劳的。
