Mozart, the great and enduring musical genius, doesn’t conform to our stereotypical notion of a musical prodigy.  

莫扎特，这位伟大而持久的音乐天才，并不符合我们对音乐神童的刻板印象。

Did he practice for hours per day? Nope. Was he well intentioned with his plans? Also no. 

他每天练习几个小时吗？没有。他的计划是出于好意吗？也没有。

More of a partier than a conscientious adult, Mozart, as biographers have described him, was someone who was “much addicted to trifling amusement.”  

正如传记作者所描述的那样，莫扎特更像是一个派对狂，而不是一个尽职尽责的成年人，他是一个“沉迷于琐碎娱乐”的人。

Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that he also wasn’t known for finishing compositions promptly. In fact, in late October of 1787, after having all but wrapped up the score for *Don Giovanni*, he decided to go out for a night of drinking with buddies. Toward the end of the evening, one friend nervously turned to Mozart and remarked that with the opera due to be performed for the first time the next day, he couldn’t believe that the overture hadn’t been written yet!  

那么，他也不以迅速完成作品而闻名，这也许并不奇怪。事实上，1787 年 10 月下旬，在几乎完成了《唐璜》的配乐后，他决定和朋友们一起出去喝酒。晚会快结束时，一位朋友紧张地转向莫扎特，说这部歌剧第二天就要首演，他简直不敢相信序曲还没有写出来！

Mozart hurriedly returned home to start—and hopefully finish—this missing piece. But, because he kept nodding off due to the alcohol and the late hour, he asked his wife, Constanze, to help him stay awake by telling him stories.  

莫扎特匆忙回到家，开始——并希望完成——这首缺失的乐曲。但是，由于酗酒和时间太晚，他总是打瞌睡，他请妻子康斯坦兹给他讲故事，帮助他保持清醒。

Amazingly, just three hours later, the overture was complete. Without the benefit of photocopiers, copyists had to then transcribe the orchestra’s parts by hand, and, as legend has it, the final pages made it to the theater only minutes before the curtain went up. The ink, in fact, was still wet when the orchestra members performed it for the first time. The opera was a success, and almost 250 years after that stressful debut, it’s still performed regularly at opera houses worldwide.  

令人惊讶的是，仅仅三个小时后，序曲就完成了。在没有复印机的情况下，抄写员必须手工抄写管弦乐队的部分，正如传说，最后几页在幕布升起前几分钟就被送到了剧院。事实上，当乐团成员第一次表演时，墨水还是湿的。这部歌剧获得了成功，在紧张的首演近 250 年后，它仍然在世界各地的歌剧院定期演出。

Leaving things to the last minute is a bad habit that resonates with many of us. Take the story of Tim Urban, the creator of the popular blog *Wait But Why*. A self proclaimed “master procrastinator,” he has relayed the story of how, during his final year of college, he kept putting off writing his honors thesis.  

把事情拖到最后一刻是一个与我们许多人产生共鸣的坏习惯。以流行博客 Wait But Why 的创建者蒂姆·厄本 (Tim Urban) 的故事为例。他自称“拖延症大师”，讲述了在大学最后一年他如何不断推迟撰写荣誉论文的故事。

Given that the thesis was meant to be a yearlong endeavor, the plan was to start in the fall months and slowly ramp up in January, maintaining a challenging pace of work until May, when it was due. Except that’s not what happened. Finding excuse after excuse to not get started, he finally sat down to write it two nights before the due date. Pulling not one but two all nighters in a row, he was able to dash all 90 pages off and get it in just in time.  

鉴于该论文本应是一项为期一年的工作，该计划将在秋季开始，并在 1 月份缓慢推进，保持具有挑战性的工作节奏，直到 5 月份截止。但事实并非如此。他找了一个又一个借口不开始，终于在预产期前两天晚上坐下来写。他连续通宵熬夜，不是一个而是两个通宵，他才匆匆忙忙地把90页纸全部看完并及时完成。

As he relates on his blog and in a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator/c), he received a call from one of the college administrators about a week later.  

正如他在博客和 TED 演讲中所说，大约一周后，他接到了一位大学管理人员的电话。

“Mr. Urban, we need to talk about your thesis,” the administrator said.  

“先生。厄本，我们需要谈谈你的论文。”管理员说道。

“Okay …,” Tim responded nervously.  

“好吧……”蒂姆紧张地回答。

The administrator continued. “Well … it’s the best one we’ve ever seen.”  

管理员继续说道。 “嗯……这是我们见过的最好的一个。”

In Urban’s telling of the story, you can quickly see how stunned he was to get this news.  

从厄本讲述的故事中，你很快就能看出他得知这个消息是多么震惊。

But then, after a pause, he says, “Actually, that didn’t happen at all.” It was, in fact, “a very, very bad thesis.”  

但停顿了一下后，他说：“事实上，那根本没有发生。”事实上，这是“一篇非常非常糟糕的论文”。

If only putting things off resulted in the sort of positive critical reception that *Don Giovanni* received. Most of us, however, have had experiences more like Urban’s than Mozart’s: procrastination doesn’t typically garner awards.  

如果只是推迟事情会导致唐璜收到的那种积极的批评反应。然而，我们大多数人的经历更像厄本的经历，而不是莫扎特的经历：拖延症通常不会获得奖项。

Even though you may never have procrastinated like Mozart, I’m going to guess that you’re intimately familiar with this behavior. Across the globe, about 20 percent of people are chronic procrastinators. And, while estimates of exactly how many people procrastinate to some extent are a little hard to nail down, one informal survey found that 85 percent do so in a way that bothers them.  

尽管你可能从来没有像莫扎特那样拖延，但我猜你对这种行为非常熟悉。在全球范围内，大约 20% 的人是长期拖延者。而且，虽然要准确估计有多少人会出现某种程度的拖延有点难以确定，但一项非正式调查发现，85% 的人这样做的方式令他们感到困扰。

> **In putting something off until a later point in time, we’re failing to consider how much our future self will want to avoid the same negative emotions that we’re trying to avoid right now.**
> **当我们把某件事推迟到稍后的某个时间点时，我们没有考虑到未来的自己会多么想要避免我们现在试图避免的负面情绪。**

Make no mistake: the tendency to put things off isn’t just bad for college students trying to complete long papers. As psychologist Fuschia Sirois has documented, there may be far more severe consequences: chronic procrastination is associated with a litany of undesirable outcomes, including poor mental health, anxiety, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. And this type of procrastination becomes a vicious cycle: procrastinators put off and fail to schedule the very doctor’s appointments that could help lessen some of their health care woes.  

毫无疑问：拖延的倾向不仅对试图完成长论文的大学生不利。正如心理学家 Fuschia Sirois 所记录的那样，这可能会带来更严重的后果：长期拖延会导致一系列不良后果，包括心理健康状况不佳、焦虑、高血压和心血管疾病。这种类型的拖延变成了一个恶性循环：拖延者推迟并未能安排可以帮助减轻一些医疗保健困境的医生预约。

Consider for a moment what procrastination actually is. The word is derived from the Latin *procrastinaire*, which means “put off until tomorrow.” Okay, sure, you know that. Here’s what’s more interesting: procrastination is also conceptually related to the Greek word *akrasia*, which means doing something despite knowing that it’s against your better judgment.  

思考一下什么是拖延症。这个词源自拉丁语 procrastinaire，意思是“推迟到明天”。好吧，当然，你知道。更有趣的是：拖延在概念上也与希腊词 akrasia 相关，意思是尽管知道某事违背了你更好的判断，但仍要做某事。

So, procrastination isn’t just about putting something off until tomorrow that you could just as easily take care of today. It’s also about knowing that even as you delay, you’re harming yourself.  

所以，拖延不仅仅是把今天就能轻松处理的事情推迟到明天。它还意味着要知道，即使你拖延，你也在伤害自己。

Think about this definition in light of our present and future selves.  

根据我们现在和未来的自己来思考这个定义。

When we’re faced with an unpleasant task—say, folding the laundry or finally making that appointment with the cardiologist—and we decide *not* to do it, we prioritize our present self’s desire to avoid negative emotions. We get anchored on our feelings in the present. But procrastination presents an additional wrinkle: in putting something off until a later point in time, we’re also failing to consider how much our future self will want to avoid the same negative emotions that we’re trying to avoid right now.  

当我们面临一项不愉快的任务时——比如叠衣服或最终与心脏病专家预约——而我们决定不做这件事时，我们会优先考虑当前自我避免负面情绪的愿望。我们专注于当下的感受。但拖延带来了额外的麻烦：在把某件事推迟到稍后的某个时间点时，我们也没有考虑到未来的自己会多么想要避免我们现在试图避免的同样的负面情绪。

Note that it’s not as if we’re simply failing to consider our future selves. When we procrastinate, we do think about the future and our future selves but not in a particularly deep or meaningful manner.  

请注意，这并不是说我们只是没有考虑未来的自己。当我们拖延时，我们确实会思考未来和未来的自己，但不会以特别深刻或有意义的方式思考。

> **When we procrastinate, we do think about the future and our future selves but not in a particularly deep or meaningful manner.**
> **当我们拖延时，我们确实会思考未来和未来的自己，但不会以特别深刻或有意义的方式思考。**

In this way, procrastination represents a time traveling mistake we make when thinking about our future self: poorly planning our trips. It’s as if you’re about to go on a weeklong Boston vacation and have in mind some ideas of what you want to do once you’re there. You’d probably like to try some Boston specific foods and maybe take in some of the rich cultural history. But only once you’ve boarded the plane do you realize that, outside of booking a hotel room, you’ve made very few plans. Maybe you’ll still be able to get some clam chowder, but if you were hoping for a tour of Fenway Park or a visit to Paul Revere’s house—attractions that could sell out quickly—your future self might end up disappointed.  

这样，拖延就代表了我们在思考未来的自己时所犯的一个时间旅行错误：没有很好地计划我们的旅行。就好像您即将去波士顿度过为期一周的假期，并且心中已经有了一些到达目的地后想做的事情的想法。您可能想尝试一些波士顿特有的食物，也许还想了解一些丰富的文化历史。但只有当您登上飞机后，您才会意识到，除了预订酒店房间之外，您几乎没有制定任何计划。也许您仍然可以吃到一些蛤蜊浓汤，但如果您希望游览芬威球场或参观保罗·里维尔的故居（这些景点可能很快就会售完），未来的您可能会失望。

You’ll still be taking a trip to Boston, but one that differs significantly from the trip you intended to take.

您仍将前往波士顿旅行，但这次旅行与您打算进行的旅行有很大不同。

So, too, is it the case with time travel: in thinking about the future in a merely surface level way, we end up traveling to a different future than the one we meant to go to. It’s as if we want to arrive at one particular version of the future—where we are happy, healthy, and financially secure—but allow ourselves to go down a path that could potentially land us in a very different place.  

时间旅行也是如此：当我们仅仅以表面的方式思考未来时，我们最终会旅行到一个与我们原本想去的不同的未来。就好像我们想要到达一个特定的未来版本——在那里我们快乐、健康、经济安全——但允许自己走一条可能会把我们带到一个非常不同的地方的道路。

Tim Pychyl, a psychology professor at Carleton University in Canada, has looked at just this sort of time travel mistake.

加拿大卡尔顿大学心理学教授蒂姆·皮切尔（Tim Pychyl）研究了这种时间旅行错误。

In [one study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-37646-014), he and his former student Eve Marie Blouin Hudon surveyed hundreds of college students. (While conducting research on undergraduates often comes with limitations, they present an excellent testing ground for all things having to do with not completing assignments on time.) The scientists asked the students about their procrastination habits as well as the relationships they have with their future selves. Those who felt more of a sense of similarity and emotional connection with their future selves, it turned out, were also the least likely to needlessly delay the critical tasks they set out to do.

在一项研究中，他和他以前的学生 Eve Marie Blouin Hudon 对数百名大学生进行了调查。 （虽然对本科生进行研究通常存在局限性，但它们为所有与未按时完成作业有关的事情提供了一个极好的试验场。）科学家们向学生询问了他们的拖延习惯以及他们与未来的关系自己。事实证明，那些与未来的自己有更多相似感和情感联系的人也最不可能不必要地推迟他们即将完成的关键任务。

It wasn’t just a sense of similarity and connection that mattered, though. The research participants were also asked how vividly they imagined the future. For instance, if you were in this study, you’d be asked to think of an image of the sun rising over the ocean on a hazy day. In your mind’s eye, how vivid is that image? At one extreme, it might be super clear—almost as if it’s something you could see right in front of you. At the other extreme, though, it might be as if there’s no image at all, but rather, you just sort of “know” you are thinking about the sun rising.

不过，重要的不仅仅是相似感和联系感。研究参与者还被问及他们对未来的想象有多生动。例如，如果您参与这项研究，您会被要求想象一幅在雾霾天太阳从海洋升起的图像。在你的脑海中，这个形象有多生动？在一种极端情况下，它可能非常清晰——几乎就像你可以在你面前看到一样。然而，在另一个极端，可能就好像根本没有图像，相反，你只是“知道”你正在考虑太阳升起。

In Blouin Hudon and Pychyl’s research, the students who reported conjuring the most vivid mental images also felt the strongest relationships with their future selves and were the least likely to procrastinate.

在 Blouin Hudon 和 Pychyl 的研究中，那些能够想象出最生动的心理图像的学生也感受到了与未来的自己最牢固的关系，并且最不可能拖延。

> **In thinking about the future in a merely surface level way, we end up traveling to a different future than the one we meant to go to.**
> **如果我们仅仅以表面的方式思考未来，我们最终会走向一个与我们原本想去的不同的未来。**

These are correlations, but they’re suggestive of something compelling. Having an easier time fully and vividly imagining ourselves in the future may make it harder to justify putting something off to the version of ourselves who will suffer from today’s failures to act. Because we can conjure up the disappointment of our future self in Boston, we’re more likely to exert the effort required to plan the “right” trip.  

这些是相关性，但它们暗示了一些令人信服的事情。更容易充分、生动地想象未来的自己，可能会让我们更难证明推迟某些事情是合理的，因为我们会因今天的行动失败而遭受痛苦。因为我们可以想象未来的自己在波士顿的失望，所以我们更有可能付出努力来计划“正确”的旅行。

I reached out to Professor Pychyl to ask him a bit more about this work. I was naturally curious whether he—an international expert in the study of procrastination—ever finds himself, well, procrastinating.  

我联系了 Pychyl 教授，向他询问了有关这项工作的更多信息。我自然好奇他——一位研究拖延症的国际专家——是否发现自己有拖延症。

“Almost never!” he told me with a laugh. But not, he cautioned, due to some great virtue on his part. Instead, he reportedly recognizes procrastination for what it is: a desire to have our future selves do the things our present selves want to avoid. As he put it, “I know my future self isn’t going to want to do this thing any more than my present self does. And I have empathy for my future self: he’s going to be under enormous amounts of stress, so let’s just do this thing now.”  

“几乎从不！”他笑着告诉我。但他警告说，由于他的某些伟大美德，事实并非如此。相反，据报道，他认识到拖延症的本质：渴望让未来的自己做现在的自己想要避免的事情。正如他所说，“我知道未来的我不会比现在的我更想做这件事。我对未来的自己有同理心：他将承受巨大的压力，所以我们现在就做这件事吧。”
