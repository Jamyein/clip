Here’s a quotation from one of Harvard’s many committees. Try to guess the year it was written.  
这是哈佛大学众多委员会之一的引述。尝试猜测它的写作年份。

“Grades A and B are sometimes given too readily — Grade A for work of no very high merit, and Grade B for work not far above mediocrity … One of the chief obstacles to raising the standards of the degree is the readiness with which insincere students gain passable grades by sham work.”  
“有时，A 级和 B 级的评定过于容易——A 级是指成绩不高的工作，B 级是指工作水平不高的工作……提高学位标准的主要障碍之一是不真诚的学生的准备程度。通过假工作获得及格的成绩。”

This is from the “Committee on Raising the Standard” in 1894. Ever since letter grades at Harvard were established, perhaps as early as 1883 according to school archives, there's been concern around the way they’re distributed.  
这是 1894 年“提高标准委员会”提出的。自从哈佛建立字母评分以来，根据学校档案，可能早在 1883 年，人们就一直担心它们的分配方式。

There’s still a lot of talk around Harvard’s grade inflation problem today. It’s hardly a surprise to anyone who studies or teaches here that grades have risen over time. But grade inflation is inextricably linked to a worse problem, one that is seldom discussed: grade compression, where GPAs stop increasing and instead stabilize in the 3.8 to 4.0 range.  
如今，关于哈佛成绩膨胀问题的讨论仍然很多。对于在这里学习或教书的人来说，成绩随着时间的推移而提高并不奇怪。但成绩膨胀与一个更严重的问题有着千丝万缕的联系，这个问题很少被讨论：成绩压缩，GPA 停止增加，而是稳定在 3.8 到 4.0 的范围内。

To understand grade compression, we first need to understand grade inflation. Looking at a graph of student GPAs since 1889 is sort of like looking at a graph of Harvard’s endowment: It only goes up. In 1950, when Harvey Mansfield was but a freshman at Harvard, the average GPA was estimated at 2.55. Now, it’s much closer to 3.80. Keep in mind these numbers are estimated from Crimson surveys that represent only a part of the student body, combined with [third-party analyses](https://gradeinflation.com/Harvard.html) of Harvard records, so try to focus on the long-term trend rather than specific GPA averages at any point in time.  
要了解成绩压缩，我们首先需要了解成绩膨胀。查看 1889 年以来学生 GPA 的图表有点像查看哈佛捐赠基金的图表：它只会上升。 1950 年，哈维·曼斯菲尔德 (Harvey Mansfield) 还是哈佛大学一年级新生，平均 GPA 估计为 2.55。现在，它更接近 3.80。请记住，这些数字是根据仅代表部分学生群体的 Crimson 调查以及对哈佛记录的第三方分析得出的估计值，因此请尽量关注长期趋势，而不是任何时间点的特定 GPA 平均值。

In addition to GPA, Harvard uses several grade classifications like summa cum laude or the lesser known Dean’s List. In fact, the Dean’s List used to be a brag-worthy achievement. Harvard President Nathan Pusey, according to Harry Lewis’ “Excellence Without a Soul,” boasted in 1954 that Harvard students “may take pride in the fact that last year forty percent of all Harvard undergraduates were on the Dean’s List.” By the time Harvard moved to abolish the Dean’s List, 92 percent of students qualified.  
除了 GPA 之外，哈佛大学还使用多种成绩分类，例如最高成绩或鲜为人知的院长名单。事实上，院长名单曾经是一个值得吹嘘的成就。根据哈里·刘易斯 (Harry Lewis) 的《没有灵魂的卓越》(Excellence Without a Soul)，哈佛校长内森·普西 (Nathan Pusey) 在 1954 年夸口说，哈佛学生“可能会因为去年 40% 的哈佛本科生进入院长名单而感到自豪”。当哈佛大学废除院长名单时，92% 的学生符合资格。

Harvard is not alone in rising grades. Most universities have experienced grade inflation, according to retired Duke Professor Stuart Rojstaczer’s research at [gradeinflation.com](http://gradeinflation.com/) (not to be confused with [gradeinflation.net](http://gradeinflation.net/), which redirects you to Harvard’s homepage — not a joke).  
哈佛大学并不是唯一一个成绩不断上升的学校。根据退休杜克大学教授斯图尔特·罗伊斯塔泽 (Stuart Rojstaczer) 在gradeinflation.com（不要与gradeinflation.net混淆，后者会将你重定向到哈佛大学的主页——不是开玩笑）的研究显示，大多数大学都经历过成绩膨胀。

Importantly, the pace of grade inflation – i.e. the rate of grade increases — needs to be distinguished from rising grades. In other words, grades may still increase for the foreseeable future, but will they do so at a slower or faster rate than in the 2000s or 2010s?  
重要的是，成绩膨胀的速度——即成绩增长的速度——需要与成绩上升区分开来。换句话说，在可预见的未来，成绩可能仍会提高，但增幅会比 2000 年代或 2010 年代更慢还是更快？

It is probable that Harvard’s grade inflation will soon peak and level out in the next decade or two. Unlike the price of a Jefe’s burrito, which has no theoretical limit, GPAs can only go so high: 4.0. If grade inflation continues at its 2021-2022 pace, for example, the average GPA of the Class of 2028 would be over 4.0. I don’t think Harvard would let this happen, so I predict we’ll see grade growth rates slow.  
哈佛的成绩膨胀很可能很快就会达到顶峰，并在未来一两年内趋于平稳。与 Jefe’s 墨西哥卷饼的价格没有理论上的限制不同，GPA 只能达到这么高：4.0。例如，如果年级通胀继续保持 2021-2022 年的速度，2028 届的平均 GPA 将超过 4.0。我认为哈佛不会让这种情况发生，所以我预测我们会看到成绩增长缓慢。

Because grades are being pushed against the 4.0 ceiling, the grades of the student body will converge more and more, a phenomenon called “grade compression.” Think of a bell curve getting tighter and taller, as more and more student GPAs get closer and closer to around a 3.8 or 3.9. Recent data support this view, as grades are increasingly compressing around 3.85, meaning there’s less grade variation between students.  
由于成绩被推向4.0的上限，学生群体的成绩会越来越趋同，这种现象称为“成绩压缩”。想象一下，随着越来越多的学生 GPA 越来越接近 3.8 或 3.9 左右，钟形曲线变得越来越紧。最近的数据支持了这一观点，因为成绩越来越压缩在 3.85 左右，这意味着学生之间的成绩差异越来越小。

Why is this a problem? Grade compression stops students from making the best pedagogical choices.  
为什么这是个问题？成绩压缩使学生无法做出最佳的教学选择。

When grades weren’t as inflated, a stray C+ or B- was to be expected. As A-’s become the new default and grades stabilize at the upper end, any lower grade is seen as a failure. Because most students receive consistently high scores, the cost of experimenting with hard classes or new subjects substantially rises.  
当成绩没有那么夸张时，杂散的 C+ 或 B- 是可以预料的。随着 A- 成为新的默认值并且成绩稳定在高端，任何较低的成绩都被视为失败。由于大多数学生始终获得高分，因此尝试困难课程或新科目的成本大幅上升。

A study of Duke students found that they were more likely to take classes from professors who graded more easily. Harvard students, who can be very risk-averse and afraid of failure, will certainly err towards easier classes or departments.  
一项针对杜克大学学生的研究发现，他们更有可能选择评分更容易的教授授课。哈佛学生非常厌恶风险并害怕失败，他们肯定会选择更简单的课程或院系。

Grade compression ultimately perverts the liberal arts education, which should center on risk-taking and pushing oneself intellectually instead of sheltering in “easy-A” classes. Harvard hopes that its “liberal arts and sciences philosophy encourages students to step outside their comfort zone,” but how can students ever exhibit genuine curiosity or experiment academically when the potential damage to one’s transcript is so high?  
成绩压缩最终会扭曲文科教育，文科教育应该以冒险和推动自己的智力为中心，而不是躲在“简单的A”课程中。哈佛大学希望其“文科和理科哲学鼓励学生走出自己的舒适区”，但当一个人的成绩单的潜在损害如此之大时，学生如何表现出真正的好奇心或进行学术实验呢？

Further, the social economy of grades, in which students receive more praise for getting an A in a gem than they would if they chose to struggle through a truly challenging course and get a B, has taken on a life of its own.  
此外，成绩的社会经济已经形成了自己的生命力，在这种社会经济中，学生因获得A而获得的赞扬比他们选择努力完成真正具有挑战性的课程并获得B的奖励要多。

There’s no easy solution to either grade inflation or grade compression. Other colleges have experimented with grade deflation or rationing of As, but changes as radical as those are unlikely to be implemented soon.  
无论是等级膨胀还是等级压缩，都没有简单的解决方案。其他大学也尝试过降级或配给A，但像这些激进的改变不太可能很快实施。

Instead, I think sunlight is the best disinfectant. Harvard should immediately release annual grade distributions (they [stopped doing so in 2006](https://archive.nytimes.com/economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/as-have-been-harvards-most-common-grade-for-20-years/)), allowing greater understanding and analysis of the problem. We can’t, after all, confront a reality we can only understand through extrapolated estimates.  
相反，我认为阳光是最好的消毒剂。哈佛大学应该立即发布年度成绩分布（他们在 2006 年停止这样做），以便更好地理解和分析问题。毕竟，我们无法面对只能通过推断估计来理解的现实。

More importantly, if average grades for classes or departments were released, then students’ transcripts could be put into greater context. You may have gotten a C in Math 55 but your potential employer could see the average grade was a B+. Curious students would no longer have to fear pursuing a harder class or concentration.  
更重要的是，如果公布班级或院系的平均成绩，那么学生的成绩单就可以得到更大的背景。您可能在数学 55 中获得了 C，但您的潜在雇主可能会看到平均成绩为 B+。好奇的学生将不再需要担心学习更难的课程或集中注意力。

The damage of grade inflation has largely been done as there’s no hope of returning to a grading scheme where a C is average. But we can still resolve the growing threat of grade compression before it wreaks further havoc on Harvard’s education. Maybe it’s time for another “Committee on Raising the Standard” — 128 years later.  
分数膨胀的损害在很大程度上已经造成，因为没有希望回到 C 为平均分的评分方案。但我们仍然可以在分数压缩对哈佛教育造成进一步破坏之前解决它日益严重的威胁。 128 年后，也许是时候成立另一个“提高标准委员会”了。
