[Daily Stoic Emails 每日斯多葛派电子邮件](https://dailystoic.com/category/daily-stoic-emails/)

People will take things from you (as we talked about recently [with Epictetus and his lamp](https://dailystoic.com/help-them-be-better/)). People will betray you–as Marcus Aurelius was by his most trusted general, Avidius Cassius. People will lie, they will cheat, they will break the rules, they will blow apart the \*mos morium–\*as Cato knew all too well.  
人们会从你那里拿走东西（正如我们最近与Epictetus和他的灯所谈论的那样）。人们会背叛你——就像马库斯·奥勒留被他最信任的将军阿维迪乌斯·卡西乌斯（Avidius Cassius）背叛一样。人们会撒谎，他们会作弊，他们会破坏规则，他们会炸毁\*mos morium——正如卡托非常清楚的那样。

This will be painful. It may even be costly.  
这将是痛苦的。它甚至可能很昂贵。

But the one thing you can’t allow them to take from you–the one thing you really have to protect–is your belief in, your love of those very same people. In *[Meditations](https://store.dailystoic.com/pages/meditations)*, Marcus Aurelius talks about being in the ring with someone who is fighting dirty. He says you can’t let them turn you into a dirty fighter, or worse, drive you from the ring altogether. In many places in his writings he comes back to this idea–to not let inhumanity drive him away from humanity, to not give up on people, to not become cynical or bitter, to not be implicated in the ugliness.  
但有一件事你不能允许他们从你身上夺走——你真正必须保护的一件事——是你的信念，你对那些人的爱。在《沉思录》中，马库斯·奥勒留谈到了与一个肮脏战斗的人一起在擂台上。他说你不能让他们把你变成一个肮脏的战士，或者更糟的是，把你完全赶出拳击场。在他的著作中，他回到了这个想法——不要让非人性驱使他远离人性，不要放弃人，不要变得愤世嫉俗或痛苦，不要被丑陋牵连到丑陋中。

When Epictetus was robbed, he could have become sullen or scared. He could have become paranoid or suspicious. Instead, [he just got a new lamp](https://dailystoic.com/how-to-own-things/). When [Marcus was betrayed](https://dailystoic.com/stoic-response-betrayal/), he could have descended into the dark places that many emperors–who lived in fear of assassination daily–descended into. Instead, he tried to use it as an opportunity to show how civil strife could be dealt with peacefully. He tried to forgive.  
当埃皮克提图斯被抢劫时，他可能会变得闷闷不乐或害怕。他可能会变得偏执或多疑。相反，他只是得到了一盏新灯。当马库斯被背叛时，他本可以下降到许多皇帝 - 他们每天都生活在暗杀的恐惧中 - 下降到黑暗的地方。相反，他试图以此为契机，展示如何和平处理内乱。他试图原谅。

It sucks that you were lied to, stolen from, abused, cheated, your trust taken advantage of. There’s no way you can get that back. But what you can do is make sure that the most important thing of all remains in your possession: Your love of other people. Your tolerance for them. Your willingness to help and do good for them. Don’t let that be stolen too. It’s priceless.  
你被骗了，被偷走了，被虐待了，被欺骗了，你的信任被利用了，这很糟糕。你没有办法把它找回来。但你能做的是确保最重要的东西仍然在你手中：你对他人的爱。你对他们的容忍。你愿意帮助他们并为他们做好事。不要让它也被偷走。这是无价的。
