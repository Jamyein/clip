[Matt Yglesias’ five-year old son asks](https://www.slowboring.com/p/19-thoughts-on-affirmative-action): why do we send the top students to the best colleges? Why not send the weakest students to the best colleges, since they need the most help? This is one of those questions that’s so naive it loops back and becomes interesting again.  
马特·伊格莱西亚斯（Matt Yglesias）五岁的儿子问：我们为什么要把顶尖学生送到最好的大学？为什么不把最弱的学生送到最好的大学，因为他们最需要帮助？这是其中一个如此幼稚的问题，它循环回去并再次变得有趣。

To avoid corrupting the youth, we might provide an optimistic answer: anyone can teach addition, any college math major can teach calculus, but it takes a world expert to teach ten-dimensional hypertopology. We want to take the few students smart enough to learn hypertopology and connect them to the few experts smart enough to teach it. But this seems false; most of the classes at top colleges are the same material that gets taught everywhere else; you don’t get into subjects that need world experts until postgrad.  
为了避免腐蚀年轻人，我们可以提供一个乐观的答案：任何人都可以教加法，任何大学数学专业都可以教微积分，但需要世界专家来教授十维超拓扑。我们希望让少数足够聪明的学生学习超拓扑学，并将他们与少数聪明到足以教授超拓扑学的专家联系起来。但这似乎是错误的;顶尖大学的大多数课程都是在其他任何地方教授的相同材料;直到研究生毕业，你才进入需要世界专家的学科。

Another answer, still somewhat optimistic: we want to maximize the chance of geniuses doing revolutionary work. If we give a mediocre student the world’s best writing teacher, and a genius a mediocre writing teacher, they might each write a pretty good novel. But if we give a mediocre student a mediocre writing teacher, and the genius the world’s best writing teacher, then we might get one mediocre novel and one work of staggering genius which revolutionizes literature forever. Likewise, if we connect the world’s most talented young scientists to the world’s best science teachers and labs, maybe they’ll cross some threshold of understanding where they can discover a cure for cancer. I think this is the best explanation that sticks to optimistic prosocial answers.  
另一个答案，仍然有些乐观：我们希望最大限度地增加天才做革命性工作的机会。如果我们给一个平庸的学生一个世界上最好的写作老师，一个天才一个平庸的写作老师，他们每个人可能会写出一部相当不错的小说。但是，如果我们给一个平庸的学生一个平庸的写作老师，给天才一个世界上最好的写作老师，那么我们可能会得到一部平庸的小说和一部永远彻底改变文学的惊人天才作品。同样，如果我们将世界上最有才华的年轻科学家与世界上最好的科学教师和实验室联系起来，也许他们会跨越一些理解的门槛，在那里他们可以发现治愈癌症的方法。我认为这是坚持乐观的亲社会答案的最好解释。

(Is is true? An oft-cited paper, [Dale and Krueger](https://www.nber.org/papers/w17159), appears to find that, controlling for applicant characteristics, people who attend more selective college don’t earn more money later in life. Here’s [a gesture at a challenge to these results](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/27/colleges-admissions-selective-schools/), apparently supported by Dale and Krueger themselves, though I can’t find any more information. Earnings are a poor proxy for “teaches better” - it would be great to have something like value-add to GRE scores - but AFAIK no study like that exists.)  
（是真的吗？一篇经常被引用的论文Dale和Krueger似乎发现，在控制申请人的特征时，上更挑剔的大学的人在以后的生活中不会赚更多的钱。这是对这些结果的挑战，显然得到了戴尔和克鲁格自己的支持，尽管我找不到更多信息。收入是“教得更好”的糟糕代表 - 对GRE分数有增值之类的东西会很棒 - 但AFAIK没有这样的研究存在。

What if we’re more cynical, and believe in the [signaling theory of education](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2021/10/19/why-higher-education-should-take-the-signalling-critique-seriously-and-what-that-might-look-like/)?  
如果我们更加愤世嫉俗，相信教育的信号理论呢？

We could think of “the best college” as a self-fulfilling prophecy; for whatever reason, one college has gotten a reputation as the one whose signal is most valuable. Everyone naturally tries to get in there; if they fail, they go to the college with the next-best reputation, and so on. The system is stable; the “best” college will keep its reputation (since it gets the best students) and the best students will always want to go to the best college. If, as Matt’s son suggests, all the Ivies started accepting the worst students instead, an Ivy degree would soon become a signal that you’re bad, and employers would stop respecting it.  
我们可以将“最好的大学”视为一个自我实现的预言;无论出于何种原因，一所大学都获得了信号最有价值的声誉。每个人都自然而然地试图进入那里;如果他们失败了，他们就会去声誉次佳的大学，依此类推。系统稳定;“最好的”大学将保持其声誉（因为它拥有最好的学生），而最好的学生总是想去最好的大学。如果像马特的儿子所建议的那样，所有的常春藤大学都开始接受最差的学生，那么常春藤学位很快就会成为你不好的信号，雇主将不再尊重它。

I heard a fascinating variation of this hypothesis from [Matt Christman of Chapo Trap House](https://medium.com/@matthewjwatson/the-dirtbag-left-at-harvard-an-interview-with-chapo-trap-house-e5fca62780dc): elite colleges are machines for laundering privilege.  
我从Chapo Trap House的马特·克里斯特曼（Matt Christman）那里听到了这个假设的一个有趣的变体：精英大学是清洗特权的机器。

That is: Harvard accepts (let’s say) 75% smart/talented people, and 25% rich/powerful people. This is a good deal for both sides. The smart people get to network with elites, which is the first step to becoming elite themselves. And the rich people get mixed in so thoroughly with a pool of smart/talented people that everyone assumes they must be smart/talented themselves. After all, they have a degree from Harvard!  
也就是说：哈佛接受（比方说）75%的聪明/有才华的人，25%的富人/有权势的人。这对双方来说都是一笔好交易。聪明的人可以与精英建立联系，这是自己成为精英的第一步。富人与一群聪明/有才华的人混得如此彻底，以至于每个人都认为他们自己一定很聪明/有才华。毕竟，他们拥有哈佛的学位！

The most blatant form of this obfuscation: suppose you own a very successful family business. You can leave your son your fortune, you can leave him the business, you can leave him your mansion, but you can’t (directly) leave him an aura of having deserved all these things. What you *can* do is make a $10 million donation to Harvard in exchange for them accepting your son. Your son gets a Harvard degree, a universally-recognized sign of being a highly meritorious person. Then when you leave him the business, everyone will agree he deserves it. Who said anything about nepotism? Leaving a Harvard graduate in control of your business is an excellent decision!  
这种混淆最明显的形式是：假设你拥有一个非常成功的家族企业。你可以把你的财产留给你的儿子，你可以把生意留给他，你可以把你的豪宅留给他，但你不能（直接）给他留下一个应得的光环。你能做的就是向哈佛捐款1000万美元，以换取他们接受你的儿子。你的儿子获得了哈佛学位，这是公认的一个非常有功绩的人的标志。然后，当你把生意留给他时，每个人都会同意他应得的。谁说了裙带关系？让哈佛毕业生控制您的业务是一个很好的决定！

This happens a little, but I think it mostly isn’t this obvious. More often the transactions are for abstract goods: prestige, associations, favors. The Maharaja of Whereverstan sends his daughter to Harvard so that she appears meritorious. In exchange, Harvard gets the credibility boost of being the place the Maharaja of Whereverstan sent his daughter. And Harvard’s other students get the advantage of networking with the Princess Of Whereverstan. Twenty years later, when one of them is an oil executive and Whereverstan is handing out oil contracts, she puts in a word with her old college buddy the Princess and gets the deal. It’s obvious what the oil executive has gotten out of this, but what does the Princess get? I think she gets the right to say she went to Harvard, an honor which is known to go *mostly* to the meritorious.  
这种情况发生了一点，但我认为它大多不是那么明显。更常见的交易是针对抽象商品的：声望、协会、恩惠。Whereverstan的Maharaja将他的女儿送到哈佛，以便她看起来有功绩。作为交换，哈佛获得了可信度的提升，成为Whereverstan大君送他女儿的地方。哈佛的其他学生也获得了与Whereverstan公主建立联系的优势。二十年后，当其中一位是石油高管，而Whereverstan正在分发石油合同时，她与她的大学老伙伴公主说了一句话，并得到了这笔交易。很明显，石油高管从中得到了什么，但公主得到了什么？我认为她有权说她去了哈佛，众所周知，这种荣誉主要属于功勋者。

People ask why Harvard admissions can still be bribed or influenced by the rich or well-connected. This is the wrong question: the right question is why they ever give spots based on merit at all. The answer is: otherwise the scheme wouldn’t work. The point of a money-laundering operation is to take in both fairly-earned and dirty money, then mix them together so thoroughly that nobody can tell which is which. Likewise, the point of a privilege-laundering operation is to take in both fairly-earned and dirty privilege, then stamp both with a Harvard degree. “Fairly-earned privilege” means all the brilliant talented ambitious youngsters admitted on the basis of their SAT scores and grades and impressive accomplishments; “dirty privilege” means the kids of various old-money aristocrats, foreign potentates, and ordinary super-rich people. Colleges mix them together, with advantages for both groups.  
人们会问，为什么哈佛的招生仍然可以受到富人或有关系的人的贿赂或影响。这是一个错误的问题：正确的问题是他们为什么要根据优点给出位置。答案是：否则该计划将行不通。洗钱行动的目的是吸收公平赚来的钱和肮脏的钱，然后将它们彻底混合在一起，以至于没有人能分辨哪个是哪个。同样，特权清洗行动的目的是同时获得公平获得的特权和肮脏的特权，然后用哈佛学位盖章。“公平获得的特权”是指所有才华横溢的雄心勃勃的年轻人根据他们的SAT成绩和成绩以及令人印象深刻的成就录取;“肮脏特权”是指各种老钱贵族、外国当权者、普通超级富豪的孩子。大学将它们混合在一起，对两个群体都有好处。

Is this good or bad? It’s good insofar as it provides a justification for making some elite positions dependent on merit and accessible to anyone, but bad insofar as it helps defend and obfuscate the ones that aren’t. It’s good if you think it’s good for all the elites (meritocratic and otherwise) to know each other and be on the same page; it’s bad if you don’t want them to be (maybe because it helps them oppress people more efficiently).  
这是好事还是坏事？这很好，因为它提供了一个理由，使一些精英职位依赖于功绩，任何人都可以获得，但坏事在于它有助于捍卫和混淆那些不是的职位。如果你认为所有精英（精英和其他精英）相互了解并在同一页面上是件好事;如果你不希望他们成为这样，那就很糟糕了（也许是因为它可以帮助他们更有效地压迫人们）。

I expect that without such a system the elites would do their own thing without any concession to merit whatsoever - so maybe it beats the alternative.  
我希望，如果没有这样的制度，精英们会做自己的事情，而不会对功绩做出任何让步——所以也许它胜过另一种选择。
