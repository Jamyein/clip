## Babies, Toddlers and Preschoolers

婴儿、幼儿和学龄前儿童

Sleep is perhaps most critical during the first years of life, and babies sleep in long stretches, both during the day and at night. Newborns spend 14 to 17 hours sleeping each day; once infants hit the 4-month mark, they tend to sleep a little less, around 12 to 16 hours over a 24-hour period.

睡眠在生命的最初几年可能是最重要的，婴儿的睡眠时间很长，无论白天还是晚上。新生儿每天睡眠时间为14至17小时；一旦婴儿达到 4 个月大，他们的睡眠时间往往会减少一些，24 小时内的睡眠时间约为 12 至 16 小时。

Achieving that amount of sleep isn’t always easy — babies are “inherently little agents of chaos,” said Dr. Craig Canapari, a pediatric sleep expert at Yale University. Sleep training, the process of teaching babies how to soothe themselves at night and sleep independently, can start when infants are 3 to 4 months old. While sleep training can be taxing for everyone involved, it can lead to better sleep for the whole household. ([Read more about it here](https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-sleep-train-baby.html).)

耶鲁大学儿科睡眠专家克雷格·卡纳帕里博士表示，实现如此充足的睡眠并不总是那么容易——婴儿“天生就是混乱的小代理人”。睡眠训练是教婴儿如何在夜间安抚自己并独立入睡的过程，可以从婴儿 3 至 4 个月大时开始。虽然睡眠训练对每个参与者来说都是一项艰巨的任务，但它可以为整个家庭带来更好的睡眠。 （在这里阅读更多相关信息。）

As children become toddlers and preschoolers, they need less sleep than babies do, around 10 to 14 hours over a 24-hour period. It’s important for kids this age to have a consistent bedtime and a simple nightly routine (which could include a bedtime story or song), especially as they phase out naps.

当孩子成为幼儿和学龄前儿童时，他们需要的睡眠时间比婴儿少，24 小时内大约需要 10 到 14 小时。对于这个年龄段的孩子来说，保持一致的就寝时间和简单的夜间例行公事（可能包括睡前故事或歌曲）非常重要，尤其是当他们逐渐停止小睡时。

Here are some of the most common problems that arise during these years.

以下是这些年来出现的一些最常见的问题。

### Day and night confusion is turning everything upside down.

昼夜混乱让一切都天翻地覆。

**The problem:** It can take up to 12 weeks for newborns to develop the circadian drive that prompts them to sleep during the night, Dr. Canapari said — which means babies can end up crying throughout the night and sleeping through the day.

问题是：卡纳帕里博士说，新生儿可能需要长达 12 周的时间才能形成促使他们在夜间入睡的昼夜节律驱动力，这意味着婴儿最终可能会整夜哭泣，白天睡觉。

**Try this:** Sunlight sends a powerful signal and can help your baby stay awake. While you don’t want to place infants directly in the sun, exposing them to light through a window or sitting with them outside during the day, but in shade, can help, Dr. Canapari said.

试试这个：阳光会发出强大的信号，可以帮助宝宝保持清醒。卡纳帕里博士说，虽然你不想让婴儿直接暴露在阳光下，但让他们透过窗户接受阳光照射，或者白天和他们一起坐在室外阴凉处，会有所帮助。

### Naptime is a struggle.

**The problem:** It’s normal for newborns to take up to four naps a day, Dr. Canapari said, a number that gradually diminishes as they get older. Around the 1-year mark, babies tend to take two to three naps. That third nap often falls away later, between 6 and 15 months. But at any age, nap time can become a challenge: Some kids just [refuse to rest](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/parenting/child-stop-napping.html) during the day and can be fussy and irritable without a nap.

问题是：卡纳帕里博士说，新生儿每天小睡四次是正常的，随着年龄的增长，这个数字会逐渐减少。大约一岁左右，婴儿往往会小睡两到三次。第三次小睡通常会在 6 到 15 个月后消失。但在任何年龄段，午睡时间都可能成为一项挑战：有些孩子白天拒绝休息，不午睡就会变得烦躁易怒。

**Try this:** Dr. Canapari advised paying attention to your child’s nocturnal sleep. First: Is your child more or less sleeping through the night? If not, turn to the elements of [sleep training](https://www.nytimes.com/article/how-to-sleep-train-baby.html). If your child is sleeping well at night but won’t nap during the day, make sure the routine leading up to naptime is similar to the bedtime rituals you have in place. If your child continues what Dr. Canapari calls “the nap strike,” you may want to see if your kid can go without the nap, or potentially move it earlier.

试试这个：卡纳帕里博士建议注意孩子的夜间睡眠。第一：您的孩子晚上睡得多还是少？如果没有，请转向睡眠训练的要素。如果您的孩子晚上睡得很好，但白天不会小睡，请确保午睡前的惯例与您制定的就寝仪式相似。如果您的孩子继续卡纳帕里博士所说的“小睡罢工”，您可能想看看您的孩子是否可以不小睡，或者是否可以提前休息。

### Your child keeps waking you up at night.

你的孩子总是在晚上把你吵醒。

**The problem:** After graduating to a real bed, your child may get up during the night and wake you.

问题是：在使用真正的床后，您的孩子可能会在夜间起床并吵醒您。

**Try this:** Children ages 3 and up can benefit from what Dr. Canapari calls the “hall pass” system, to incentivize them to stay in their own bed throughout the night. You can make a tangible hall pass with a piece of paper and give it to your child to use if he or she really needs you during the night — your kid can redeem the hall pass for any reason, but it should be something that takes under five minutes, like a hug, a glass of water or an accompanied trip to the bathroom.

试试这个：3 岁及以上的儿童可以受益于 Canapari 博士所说的“大厅通行证”系统，以激励他们整夜躺在自己的床上。您可以用一张纸制作一张有形的大厅通行证，并在您的孩子晚上确实需要您时将其交给他或她使用 - 您的孩子可以出于任何原因兑换大厅通行证，但它应该是可以接受的东西五分钟，比如一个拥抱、一杯水或陪同去洗手间。

If your kid doesn’t use the hall pass at all, in the morning you can grant a reward, like 10 minutes of a favorite show or a pack of stickers.

如果您的孩子根本不使用大厅通行证，您可以在早上给予奖励，例如观看 10 分钟最喜欢的节目或一包贴纸。

### Your child is scared. 你的孩子很害怕。

**The problem:** It’s common for kids to wake up at night and prod parents with questions, Dr. Canapari said. A child might voice anxieties that a robber could break into the home, for example, or a natural disaster could hit, he said.

问题是：卡纳帕里博士说，孩子们晚上醒来并向父母提出问题是很常见的。他说，例如，孩子可能会担心强盗可能闯入家中，或者担心发生自然灾害。

**Try this:** It’s important to ease your child’s worries without engaging in a long line of questioning, Dr. Canapari said. Tell your child, “It’s OK,” and say you’ll demonstrate in the morning the ways your house is secure, for instance. If your kid is afraid of the dark, a night light can help, but Dr. Canapari recommends making sure it’s not so bright you could read in the room while it’s on. You can also try out a flashlight treasure hunt during the day: Turn off the lights and hide stuffed animals or other objects across the room to help your kid get used to the dark.

试试这个：卡纳帕里博士说，重要的是要减轻孩子的担忧，而不是进行一长串的提问。例如，告诉你的孩子“没关系”，并说你将在早上展示你的房子是如何安全的。如果您的孩子害怕黑暗，夜灯会有所帮助，但卡纳帕里博士建议确保夜灯不要太亮，以至于您可以在开灯时在房间里阅读。您还可以尝试在白天用手电筒寻宝：关掉灯，将毛绒动物或其他物体藏在房间的另一边，以帮助您的孩子适应黑暗。

## Adulthood

In your 20s and 30s, you should aim for between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. But how do you know if your needs are on the higher or lower end of that spectrum? Pay attention to how tired you are throughout the week. Experts suggest spending several days without setting alarms and just waking up when your body naturally wants to, which you can try over a three-day weekend.

在 20 多岁和 30 多岁的时候，您的目标应该是每晚睡七到九个小时。但您如何知道您的需求是处于该范围的较高端还是较低端呢？注意您这一周的疲劳程度。专家建议花几天时间不设置闹钟，只在身体自然需要的时候起床，您可以在为期三天的周末尝试这样做。

Here are some of the sleep issues that come up during these years and ways to tackle them.

以下是这些年来出现的一些睡眠问题以及解决这些问题的方法。

### Your schedule is scattered.

你的日程安排很分散。

**The problem:** Often, people in their 20s and 30s wobble between rising early on weekday mornings and lingering in bed on the weekends — a pattern that disrupts your internal clock. The more you go back and forth between early and late bedtimes, the more likely you are to struggle to fall asleep when you need to.

问题：20 多岁和 30 多岁的人通常会在工作日早起和周末赖床之间摇摆不定，这种模式会扰乱你的生物钟。您在早睡和晚睡之间来回次数越多，您就越有可能在需要时难以入睡。

“By definition, if you’re using an alarm clock to wake up, then you are chronically sleep deprived,” said Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a sleep specialist at Penn Medicine. Healthy sleepers naturally wake up when sufficiently rested, and if you habitually rely on alarms, you’re being roused before your body can signal that it has had enough rest.

“根据定义，如果你使用闹钟起床，那么你就会长期睡眠不足，”宾夕法尼亚大学医学院的睡眠专家 Indira Gurubhagavatula 博士说。健康的睡眠者在充分休息后会自然醒来，如果你习惯性地依赖闹钟，那么在你的身体发出信号表示已经得到充分休息之前，你就会被叫醒。

You may also be chronically sleep-deprived if you wake up roughly two or more hours later than usual on days off. Sleep experts call this condition “social jetlag.”

如果您在休息日比平常晚起大约两个或更多小时，您也可能长期睡眠不足。睡眠专家将这种情况称为“社交时差”。

**Try this:** You don’t necessarily need to wean yourself off your alarm clock. But if you’re not getting enough sleep, try adjusting your bedtime so that you’re going to bed and waking up at roughly the same time every day, even on the weekends. For extra incentive, reward yourself for waking up early on a Saturday: Plan a morning walk, brunch or a call with a friend, or watch your favorite TV show while you eat breakfast.

试试这个：你不一定需要戒掉闹钟。但如果您睡眠不足，请尝试调整就寝时间，以便每天大致在同一时间上床睡觉和起床，即使在周末也是如此。为了获得额外的激励，奖励自己在周六早起：计划早上散步、吃早午餐或与朋友打电话，或者在吃早餐时观看您最喜欢的电视节目。

### You have insomnia with no clear cause.

您患有不明原因的失眠症。

**The problem:** Insomnia, the persistent inability to fall and remain asleep, can strike at any age, but there are proven tools to combat it. The condition doesn’t always have a clear cause, but it may occur because of family history of insomnia, stress or significant changes to your life or routines.

问题：失眠，即持续无法入睡和保持睡眠状态，可能发生在任何年龄段，但有经过验证的工具可以对抗它。这种情况并不总是有明确的原因，但可能是由于失眠家族史、压力或生活或日常生活发生重大变化而发生。

**Try this:** If you have symptoms of insomnia for more than a few weeks, it’s worth seeking solutions. Talking to a primary care doctor is a good place to start. The standard treatment for insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy, which psychologists and sleep specialists can help administer.

试试这个：如果您有失眠症状超过几周，就值得寻求解决方案。与初级保健医生交谈是一个很好的起点。失眠的标准治疗方法是认知行为疗法，心理学家和睡眠专家可以帮助实施。

### Drinking disrupts your sleep.

饮酒会扰乱你的睡眠。

**The problem:** [Alcohol](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/well/mind/alcohol-drinking-sleep.html) might make you fall asleep quickly, but drinking often leads to fragmented sleep. Having a few drinks can also send you to the bathroom hours after you nod off, making it tougher to sleep through the night.

问题：酒精可能会让你很快入睡，但饮酒往往会导致睡眠断断续续。喝几杯酒也会让你在入睡后几个小时就去洗手间，让你整晚都难以入睡。

Some people find that their sleep is particularly affected by alcohol — especially as they get older, Dr. Roth said.

罗斯博士说，有些人发现他们的睡眠特别受酒精影响，尤其是随着年龄的增长。

**Try this:** If you want to pinpoint how alcohol impacts your sleep, Dr. Gurubhagavatula suggests, keep a sleep diary and track whether you consistently feel less rested on the days after you drink.

试试这个：Gurubhagavatula 博士建议，如果您想查明酒精如何影响您的睡眠，请记下睡眠日记并跟踪您是否在饮酒后的几天里持续感到休息不足。

### You’re too stressed to sleep.

你压力太大，睡不着觉。

**The problem:**Stress and sleep create a cruel cycle: We [carry our worries](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/well/mind/anxiety-night-sleep.html) to bed with us, which in turn makes it hard to get good rest, Dr. Gurubhagavatula said. Bedtime is often the first time all day when we’re not distracted, and anxiety from the day can come into focus.

问题：压力和睡眠造成了一个残酷的循环：我们把忧虑带到床上，这反过来又使我们很难得到良好的休息，Gurubhagavatula 博士说。就寝时间通常是一天中我们第一次不分心的时间，一天中的焦虑可能会成为焦点。

**Try this:** Carve out time throughout the day to tend to your stress, Dr. Gurubhagavatula said. Set a timer for a few minutes and write out a list of your worries. Just jotting down your anxieties can help your brain recognize that you’re working to address them, which means you’re less likely to ruminate at night.

试试这个：古鲁巴加瓦图拉博士说，一天中抽出时间来缓解压力。设置一个几分钟的计时器并写下您的担忧清单。只需记下你的焦虑就可以帮助你的大脑认识到你正在努力解决它们，这意味着你不太可能在晚上沉思。

### You’re stimulated right up until bedtime.

直到睡觉前你都会受到刺激。

**The problem:** Sleep experts say that it’s critical to block out time to wind down before bed, instead of scrolling through your phone seconds before falling asleep. Whether you’re up working or engrossed in a TV show, too much stimulation can sabotage your night.

问题：睡眠专家表示，睡前留出放松的时间至关重要，而不是在入睡前几秒钟翻看手机。无论您是在工作还是全神贯注于电视节目，太多的刺激都会破坏您的夜晚。

**Try this:** Schedule at least half an hour to relax (though it’s easier said than done), ideally without a screen. Find an activity that soothes you. Maybe that’s lounging on the couch with a good podcast, occupying your hands with something like knitting or drawing in a coloring book. If you work out, consider shifting your exercise to the morning, instead of close to bedtime, as exertion right before bedtime can make it harder to fall asleep.

试试这个：安排至少半小时的放松时间（尽管说起来容易做起来难），最好不要看屏幕。找一个能让你平静下来的活动。也许就是懒洋洋地躺在沙发上听着精彩的播客，双手忙着编织或在涂色书中画画之类的事情。如果您锻炼身体，请考虑将锻炼时间转移到早上，而不是临睡前，因为睡前的锻炼可能会导致入睡更困难。

### You drink caffeine in the afternoon.

下午你喝咖啡因。

**The problem:** It can take [up to 10 hours](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15496-caffeine-how-to-hack-it-and-how-to-quit-it) for caffeine to leave your bloodstream, so a 2 p.m. cup of coffee can linger in your system as you’re trying to fall asleep, flooding your brain with signals to stay awake.

问题：咖啡因可能需要长达 10 小时才能离开血液，所以下午 2 点。当你试图入睡时，一杯咖啡会在你的系统中徘徊，让你的大脑充满保持清醒的信号。

**Try this:** Cut yourself off from caffeine at noon. Try taking a brief, brisk walk to stave off the afternoon slump — or, for the more adventurous, [stick your head in the freezer](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/well/better-sleep-tips.html) for a quick jolt of energy.

试试这个：中午不要喝咖啡因。尝试进行短暂而轻快的散步，以避免下午的精神萎靡——或者，如果喜欢冒险的话，可以把头伸进冰箱里，快速补充能量。

### Work gets in the way.

工作会妨碍你。

**The problem:** Beyond job-related stress, night shifts and jobs with changing schedules can wreak havoc on your sleep cycle, and most people struggle to get quality sleep in the hours that fall outside their natural circadian rhythm, said Dr. Sabra Abbott, a sleep medicine specialist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. Oscillating between night and day shifts can also make it tricky to get good sleep. And even those with consistent work schedules can find themselves working right up until bedtime and shutting their laptops right before falling asleep.

问题是：除了与工作相关的压力之外，夜班和工作时间不断变化也会对您的睡眠周期造成严重破坏，大多数人很难在超出自然昼夜节律的时间内获得高质量的睡眠，萨布拉·阿博特博士说，西北大学范伯格医学院睡眠医学专家。在夜班和白班之间来回切换也会让你很难获得良好的睡眠。即使是那些工作安排一致的人也会发现自己一直工作到就寝时间，并在入睡前关闭笔记本电脑。

**Try this:** Sunlight makes us feel more awake because it plays a key role in shutting down the release of [melatonin](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/mind/melatonin-sleep-insomnia.html). If you work the night shift, protect yourself from after-work sun exposure so that you can fall asleep more easily. Even sunglasses can help, said Aric Prather, a psychologist and sleep specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.

试试这个：阳光让我们感觉更清醒，因为它在阻止褪黑激素的释放方面发挥着关键作用。如果您上夜班，请保护自己免受下班后阳光照射，以便更容易入睡。加州大学旧金山分校的心理学家兼睡眠专家阿里克·普拉瑟 (Aric Prather) 表示，即使是太阳镜也有帮助。

If your schedule changes regularly, you can plan ahead by [shifting your sleep back](https://aasm.org/resources/pdf/products/shiftwork_web.pdf) about three days before your new start time, inching your bedtime forward or back by an hour or two each night. It’s also important to carve out time between work and heading to bed — ideally a half hour or longer, but even 10 minutes is better than nothing. Opt for a soothing activity (if you can, without screens), such as listening to calming music or reading a few pages, to signal to your brain that you’re winding down for the night.

如果您的日程安排经常变化，您可以提前计划，将睡眠时间推迟到新的开始时间前三天左右，每晚将就寝时间提前或推迟一两个小时。在工作和睡觉之间留出时间也很重要——最好是半小时或更长时间，但即使是 10 分钟也比没有好。选择一种舒缓的活动（如果可以的话，不要使用屏幕），例如听平静的音乐或阅读几页书，向你的大脑发出信号，告诉你今晚你要放松一下了。
