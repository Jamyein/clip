To Tivoli Gardens in the heart of Copenhagen, one of the world’s oldest amusement parks. It was founded 180 years ago, and its creator George Carstensen secured the land by petitioning King Christian VIII, arguing, “When the people are amusing themselves, they do not think about politics.”

前往哥本哈根市中心的蒂沃利花园，这是世界上最古老的游乐园之一。它成立于180年前，其创建者乔治·卡斯滕森（George Carstensen）通过向国王克里斯蒂安八世请愿来获得这片土地，认为“当人们自娱自乐时，他们不会考虑政治。

In Tivoli, I don’t think about politics either. But during the wait to ride the Demon and the Star Flyer, I can’t help but think about economics. Specifically, I think about Robert Lucas’s charming speech, “What Economists Do”. It was delivered as a commencement address in 1988, seven years before the hugely influential macroeconomist was awarded the Nobel memorial prize.

在蒂沃利，我也不考虑政治。但在等待骑恶魔和星际飞行者的过程中，我不禁想到了经济学。具体来说，我想到了罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）迷人的演讲“经济学家在做什么”。它于1988年作为毕业典礼致辞发表，比这位极具影响力的宏观经济学家获得诺贝尔纪念奖早了七年。

I revisited the speech when news reached me of Robert Lucas’s recent death at the age of 85.

当罗伯特·卢卡斯（Robert Lucas）最近去世的消息传到我这里，享年85岁时，我重温了演讲。

“We are basically storytellers,” wrote Lucas, “creators of make-believe economic systems.”

“我们基本上是讲故事的人，”卢卡斯写道，“虚构经济体系的创造者。

To illustrate his point, he told a story about a depression in an amusement park. In Lucas’s imaginary park, people buy a wad of tickets at the entry kiosk and spend them on anything from rollercoaster rides to hotdogs. Each attraction is run as an independent business, while the ticket desk serves as a central bank.

为了说明他的观点，他讲了一个关于游乐园萧条的故事。在卢卡斯想象中的公园里，人们在入口处购买一沓门票，并将它们花在从过山车到热狗的任何东西上。每个景点都作为独立的企业运营，而售票处则充当中央银行。

On a slow day, the ride owners will send their workers home. Both employment (hours worked) and the number of tickets bought (call that GDP if you wish) will vary depending on school holidays, the weather and chance.

在缓慢的日子里，乘车主会把他们的工人送回家。就业（工作时间）和购买的门票数量（如果您愿意，可以称为GDP）将根据学校假期，天气和机会而有所不同。

Should we call a slow Monday in March a depression? No, said Lucas. “By an economic depression, we mean something that ought not to happen, something pathological.”

我们应该把三月份的缓慢星期一称为萧条吗？不，卢卡斯说。“我们所说的经济萧条是指不应该发生的事情，一些病态的事情。

So then imagine that the central bank — sorry, the ticket kiosk — decides to crack down on fun by squeezing the money supply. Instead of issuing 100 tickets for DKr100, the kiosk charges DKr100 for 80 tickets. Importantly, it doesn’t tell the businesses in the park that it has decided to make this change. Without their consent or knowledge, it has effectively raised all their prices.

所以想象一下，中央银行——对不起，售票亭——决定通过挤压货币供应来打击乐趣。售货亭不是为 100 丹麦克朗 100 张罚单，而是收取 100 丹麦克朗的 80 张票。重要的是，它并没有告诉公园里的企业它已经决定做出这一改变。在未经他们同意或不知情的情况下，它有效地提高了他们所有的价格。

What happens? Some customers grit their teeth and spend a bit more to ensure they get all the tickets they would have expected anyway. Others buy fewer tickets. Some walk away without buying any.

会发生什么？一些客户咬紧牙关，多花一点钱，以确保他们无论如何都能获得他们所期望的所有门票。其他人买的票更少。有些人没有买任何东西就走了。

Inside the park, tumbleweed. There are fewer customers, and they bring sandwiches rather than buying hotdogs. They spend less on the rides and take more time to enjoy freebies such as walking around the lake. Operators who had been planning to expand in the face of long queues will now not be so sure. Other operators who had worried that their ride was going out of style see gloomy confirmation and may close permanently to cut their losses. The amusement park as a whole will lose its mojo, with physical capacity, output and employment shrinking to match a misunderstood fall in demand.

公园内，风滚草。顾客少了，他们带三明治而不是买热狗。他们在游乐设施上花费较少，并花更多时间享受免费赠品，例如在湖边散步。面对排长队而计划扩张的运营商现在不会那么确定。其他担心他们的游乐设施过时的运营商看到了悲观的确认，并可能永久关闭以减少损失。游乐园作为一个整体将失去它的魔力，物理能力，产出和就业萎缩，以匹配被误解的需求下降。

As Lucas explained, this slump “is indeed a kind of pathology. Customers are arriving, eager to spend . . . Concessionaires are ready and waiting to service them.” All the pieces are in place, but they don’t fit together because of a monetary policy mistake.

正如卢卡斯所解释的那样，这种衰退“确实是一种病理。客户正在到来，渴望消费。特许经营商已经准备好并等待为他们服务。所有部分都已到位，但由于货币政策错误，它们无法组合在一起。

Eventually, the park should recover its equilibrium. The ride owners can ask for fewer tickets per ride; the customers will come to realise that 80 tickets will buy as much as 100 tickets did before the price change. The amusement park will be lively again. But all this will take time, and permanent harm may have been done.

最终，公园应该会恢复平衡。乘车业主每次乘车可以要求更少的门票;客户会意识到，80张门票将购买与价格变化前的100张门票一样多。游乐园将再次热闹起来。但这一切都需要时间，并且可能已经造成了永久性伤害。

Flip the story around: what if the central bank — sorry, the ticket kiosk — gets excited and hands out too many tickets instead? In effect, the kiosk has slashed all the prices without telling the concession-holders. Expecting bargains, people cram into the park. The hotdog stand runs out of hotdogs; the mustard and ketchup run dry. Park-goers spend most of their time queueing rather than rollercoasting. The businesses inside may call up extra staff, even borrow money to expand. Yet eventually they will realise the double-handfuls of tickets they’ve taken in aren’t worth as much as they expected.

反过来说：如果中央银行——对不起，售票亭——感到兴奋并分发了太多票怎么办？实际上，售货亭在没有告诉特许权持有人的情况下削减了所有价格。期待便宜货，人们挤进公园。热狗摊上的热狗用完了;芥末和番茄酱干了。公园游客大部分时间都在排队，而不是过山车。里面的企业可能会召集额外的员工，甚至借钱扩张。然而，最终他们会意识到他们收到的两把门票并不像他们预期的那么值钱。

These stories tell us how a central bank might engineer a recession — or cause shortages and inflation. I find them a delightful window into how economies work.

这些故事告诉我们央行如何策划经济衰退，或导致短缺和通货膨胀。我发现它们是了解经济如何运作的令人愉快的窗口。

True, there are other types of recession. In my book [The Undercover Economist Strikes Back](https://timharford.com/books/undercovereconomist-strikes-back/), I told a true story about a recession in a prisoner-of-war camp in the 1940s, as described by one of the POWs, the economist RA Radford. The camp, like the amusement park, had a simple economy. It was fuelled by the supply of packages from the Red Cross, the contents of which were then traded: the Sikh prisoners didn’t want razor blades or beef, the French were desperate for coffee, the English craved tea.

诚然，还有其他类型的衰退。在我的《卧底经济学家反击战》一书中，我讲述了一个关于1940年代战俘营经济衰退的真实故事，正如其中一名战俘，经济学家RA Radford所描述的那样。营地和游乐园一样，经济简单。它是由红十字会提供的包裹推动的，然后交易包裹的内容：锡克教囚犯不想要剃须刀片或牛肉，法国人渴望咖啡，英国人渴望茶。

The prison-camp recession occurred, not because the money supply was constricted, but because the Red Cross parcels stopped arriving — what an economist might call an “exogenous shock”. (For a real-world example, imagine a war interrupting the supply of oil, natural gas and food. It shouldn’t be too much of a stretch to do that.)

监狱-集中营经济衰退的发生，不是因为货币供应量受限，而是因为红十字会包裹停止到达——经济学家可能称之为“外生冲击”。（举一个真实世界的例子，想象一场战争中断了石油、天然气和食品的供应。这样做应该不会太过分。

These little stories teach us that sometimes an economy can be dragged down by a simple mistake in monetary policy, while sometimes a recession occurs because the economy has hit an implacable obstacle. One job of a good central bank is to make sure that it perceives the difference, something central bankers are puzzling over right now.

这些小故事告诉我们，有时一个经济体可能会被货币政策的简单错误拖累，而有时经济衰退的发生是因为经济遇到了一个无情的障碍。一个好的中央银行的一项工作是确保它能够感知到差异，这是央行官员现在感到困惑的事情。

The disadvantage with such stories, admitted Lucas, “is that we are not really interested in understanding and preventing depressions in hypothetical amusement parks . . . the analogy that one person finds persuasive, his neighbour may well find ridiculous.”

卢卡斯承认，这些故事的缺点是“我们对理解和预防假想游乐园的萧条并不真正感兴趣......一个人觉得有说服力的类比，他的邻居可能会觉得荒谬。

So then what to do? “Keep trying to tell better and better stories . . . it is fun and interesting and, really, there is no practical alternative.”

那怎么办呢？“继续努力讲越来越好的故事......这很有趣，很有趣，真的，没有实际的选择。
