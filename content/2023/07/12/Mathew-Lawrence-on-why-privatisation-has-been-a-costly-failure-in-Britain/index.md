## The energy transition further strengthens the argument for state ownership, says the think-tank head  
智库负责人表示，能源转型进一步强化了国家所有权的论据

Jul 10th 2023 2023 年 7 月 10 日

THE BRITISH economy has been subject to a giant experiment: privatisation on a scale more extensive than in almost any other OECD country. Perhaps most strikingly, following the lead of Augusto Pinochet’s Chile, in 1989 the Conservative government privatised the water industry in England and Wales. This outlier status remains to this day: the majority of water infrastructure in other countries is held and managed by the public. To see the disastrous effects of this experiment, one need only look at England’s crisis-ridden water companies—or brave a swim in an English river flooded with sewage.  
英国经济经历了一场巨大的实验：私有化的规模比几乎任何其他经合组织国家都更广泛。也许最引人注目的是，继奥古斯托·皮诺切特 (Augusto Pinochet) 领导下的智利之后，保守党政府于 1989 年将英格兰和威尔士的水务行业私有化。这种异常状况至今仍然存在：其他国家的大部分水基础设施都是由公众持有和管理的。要了解这一实验的灾难性影响，只需看看英国陷入危机的自来水公司，或者勇敢地在一条充满污水的英国河流中游泳即可。

Emblematic of these failures is Thames Water, England’s largest water company. Having accumulated debts of £14bn ($18bn), in part the legacy of a leveraged buy-out by Macquarie, an Australian investment group, it is now precariously exposed to higher interest rates. But the problem extends beyond one company.  
这些失败的典型例子是英国最大的自来水公司泰晤士水务公司。该公司已积累了 140 亿英镑（180 亿美元）的债务，部分是澳大利亚投资集团麦格理 (Macquarie) 杠杆收购留下的遗产，现在它面临着更高利率的风险。但问题不仅仅限于一家公司。

At the time of privatisation, the water industry as a whole carried no debt, partly because £15bn had been paid off by the government beforehand. Since then the sector has accumulated £53bn in debt while distributing £72bn to shareholders, the majority of whom are international investors. English water-bill payers, who have no choice but to use their local monopoly provider, are essentially taxed without representation for the benefit of using this essential service.  
私有化时，整个水务行业没有任何债务，部分原因是政府已提前偿还了 150 亿英镑。自那时以来，该行业已积累了 530 亿英镑的债务，同时向股东分配了 720 亿英镑，其中大多数是国际投资者。英国的水费支付者别无选择，只能使用当地的垄断供应商，他们基本上是在没有代表的情况下纳税，以享受使用这项基本服务的好处。

The practice of loading a company with debt to distribute cash to shareholders and managers is especially pronounced among private-equity owners in the water industry. However, the tension between generating strong returns for investors in uncompetitive monopoly conditions and providing high-quality, affordable infrastructure to the public is as real for publicly listed companies as it is for those owned by private equity.  
让公司背负债务以向股东和管理者分配现金的做法在水务行业的私募股权所有者中尤其明显。然而，在缺乏竞争性的垄断条件下为投资者创造丰厚回报与向公众提供高质量、负担得起的基础设施之间的紧张关系对于上市公司和私募股权公司来说都是真实存在的。

The effects of this tension are clear. For example, South East Water—thousands of whose customers were left without running water this summer—spent more on dividends and servicing its debt than on infrastructure in the two years to March 2022. Water bills for Britain as a whole have increased by around 360%, more than double the rate of inflation, since privatisation. Over that time, annual capital investment by the ten largest water and sewage companies has fallen by some 15%, according to research by the *Financial Times* (*FT*). Bills are lower in Scotland, whose water company is government-owned, even though it has invested 35% more per household per year than English firms.  
这种紧张局势的影响是显而易见的。例如，截至 2022 年 3 月的两年内，东南水务公司（South East Water）的数千名客户没有自来水，其在股息和偿还债务上的支出比在基础设施上的支出还要多。整个英国的水费增加了约 360% %，是私有化以来通货膨胀率的两倍多。据英国《金融时报》(FT) 的研究显示，在此期间，十大供水和污水处理公司的年度资本投资下降了约 15%。苏格兰的水费较低，该国的自来水公司是政府所有，尽管该公司每年每户家庭的投资比英国公司高出 35%。

The case for privatisation rested on two claims, reiterated by Michael Howard, [writing recently](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/07/06/thames-water-may-be-troubled-but-privatisation-has-served-britain-well-argues-michael-howard) for *The Economist*. First, the bracing force of competition would improve utility management and hence overall outcomes. Second, it would unlock access to private capital to fund much-needed investment that would otherwise be held back by short-termism and scarcity—supposedly endemic to public ownership.  
迈克尔·霍华德最近在《经济学人》撰文时重申了私有化的两个主张。首先，竞争的支撑力将改善公用事业管理，从而改善整体结果。其次，它将释放私人资本的渠道，为急需的投资提供资金，否则这些投资将因短期主义和稀缺性而受到阻碍——据说这是公有制所特有的。

Neither claim stands up to scrutiny. Private management and weak regulation have delivered a crisis-ridden sector and chronic underinvestment. Water companies have made clear that investment will be funded mainly by increased bills, undermining the idea that private capital is essential for investment.  
这两种说法都经不起推敲。私人管理和薄弱的监管导致该行业危机四伏，长期投资不足。水务公司明确表示，投资将主要通过增加水费来提供资金，这削弱了私人资本对投资至关重要的观念。

Dogmatic adherence to privatisation in the face of its sustained failure suggests ideology, not pragmatism, was the motivation. Whether key infrastructure is publicly or privately owned, investment in its construction and maintenance will always ultimately be borne by taxpayers, bondholders and water customers. The question is whether we want to add to those costs the weight of shareholder payouts and the extra interest that private owners have to pay over sovereign borrowers. If your answer is, like mine, no, then the solution is obvious: the public ownership that prevails in most other water systems around the world.  
面对私有化的持续失败，教条主义地坚持私有化表明，意识形态而非实用主义才是动机。无论关键基础设施是公有还是私有，其建设和维护的投资最终将始终由纳税人、债券持有人和水用户承担。问题是我们是否要在这些成本中增加股东支出的比重以及私人所有者必须向主权借款人支付的额外利息。如果你的答案和我一样是“不”，那么解决方案是显而易见的：世界上大多数其他水系统中普遍存在的公有制。

Rather than defending a failing status quo, a better approach would be to use existing law to hold responsible those who have wrung the industry dry, and then to change the law’s purpose and water companies’ governance and ownership to put the public interest first—treating water as a human right and organising water networks as a critical public service.  
与其捍卫失败的现状，更好的方法是利用现有法律追究那些榨干行业的人的责任，然后改变法律的目的以及自来水公司的治理和所有权，将公共利益放在首位——水作为一项人权，并将供水网络组织为一项重要的公共服务。

The case for public ownership should rest on a sober assessment of how best to deliver fundamental public goods and services. Public ownership—which can operate at multiple levels, from the national to the municipal—is clearly not appropriate for every sector. But it allows the pursuit of a broad range of objectives beyond profit-maximisation.  
公有制的理由应该建立在对如何最好地提供基本公共产品和服务的清醒评估之上。公有制——可以在从国家到市级的多个层面运作——显然并不适合每个部门。但它允许追求利润最大化之外的广泛目标。

If the argument for public ownership is strong in water, it is even more powerful when it comes to the biggest socio-economic challenge confronting humanity: the energy transition. In the span of a decade we must undertake an unprecedented investment and divestment sprint to deliver a clean electricity system, which private ownership and market co-ordination are ill-equipped to deliver. As Derek Brower put it in a recent column in the *FT*: “The sheer scale of the physical infrastructure that must be revamped, demolished or replaced is almost beyond comprehension. Governments, not BlackRock, will have to lead this new Marshall Plan.”  
如果说公有制的论点在水资源方面是强有力的，那么当涉及到人类面临的最大社会经济挑战：能源转型时，它就更加有力。在十年内，我们必须进行前所未有的投资和撤资冲刺，以提供清洁电力系统，而私人所有制和市场协调无力实现这一目标。正如德里克·布劳尔 (Derek Brower) 在《金融时报》最近的一篇专栏中所说：“必须改造、拆除或更换的实体基础设施的规模之大几乎令人难以理解。领导这一新马歇尔计划的是各国政府，而不是贝莱德。”

From bringing new renewable-energy generation online, to dramatically expanding a backlogged grid and storage, to phasing out fossil-fuel assets, the discrete elements of grid decarbonisation aren’t discrete at all: they must be synchronised to limit physical bottlenecks and inflationary pressures. Private investment, hindered by the profit imperative and, in many quarters, a preference for liquid assets over longer-term capital investments, cannot deliver a smooth wholesale transformation of the electricity system. Public ownership offers greater affordability, more effective co-ordination and greater democratic oversight. The argument for it is built on necessity, not nostalgia.  
从引入新的可再生能源发电，到大幅扩大积压的电网和存储，再到逐步淘汰化石燃料资产，电网脱碳的离散要素根本不是离散的：它们必须同步以限制物理瓶颈和通胀压力。私人投资受到利润需求的阻碍，而且在许多方面，对流动资产而非长期资本投资的偏好，无法实现电力系统的顺利大规模转型。公有制提供了更大的负担能力、更有效的协调和更大的民主监督。支持它的论点是建立在必要性之上，而不是怀旧之上。

In his recent book, “The Death of Consensus”, Phil Tinline traced how the power of political nightmares has driven the transformation of Britain’s economy. The case for private ownership drew strength from a spectre that, advocates argued, haunted British life: sclerotic service under nationalised utilities that stood as both cause and symptom of wider national decline. Yet the age of privatisation has now produced its own nightmare: of raw sewage gushing into rivers as international shareholders profit, utility bills rising relentlessly as infrastructure creaks and, now, the potential collapse of leading water and energy companies under the weight of their own fragile, extractive business models. It is time we woke up and exorcised the ghost.■  
菲尔·廷莱恩（Phil Tinline）在其新书《共识之死》中追溯了政治噩梦的力量如何推动英国经济转型。支持者认为，私有制的理由来自一个困扰英国人生活的幽灵：国有化公用事业下的僵化服务，既是国家更广泛衰落的原因，也是其症状。然而，私有化时代现在也产生了自己的噩梦：国际股东获利时，未经处理的污水涌入河流；基础设施老化，公用事业费用不断上涨；现在，领先的水务和能源公司在自身脆弱的重压下可能倒闭。 ，采掘性商业模式。是时候我们醒来并驱除鬼魂了。■
