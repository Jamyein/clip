My roommate and I always give totally honest reviews of each other's cooking.But it's a little easier to tell someone their tomato sauce is too salty than to give feedback in a professional context, where your feedback is about someone's livelihood.

我和我的室友总是对彼此的烹饪给予完全诚实的评论。但是，告诉某人他们的番茄酱太咸比在专业环境中提供反馈要容易一些，在专业环境中，您的反馈是关于某人的生计的。

I asked professionals across industries to share stories of effective feedback they've received.Here, I'll share the examples that will help you deliver feedback your recipient can stomach—and grow from.

我请各行各业的专业人士分享他们收到的有效反馈的故事。在这里，我将分享一些示例，这些示例将帮助您提供收件人可以接受并从中成长的反馈。

## 1\.Effective feedback is all about delivery

1\.有效的反馈就是交付

Feedback is only effective if the person is receptive to it.And to get a receptive reaction, you need to overcome barriers such as distrust, confusion, and doubt.When you focus on building trust, you can lessen the feeling of [rejection](https://zapier.com/blog/reframing-rejection/)—one of the biggest and most relatable barriers to receiving feedback. 

只有当这个人接受反馈时，反馈才有效。为了获得接受性反应，您需要克服不信任、困惑和怀疑等障碍。当你专注于建立信任时，你可以减少被拒绝的感觉——这是接收反馈的最大和最相关的障碍之一。

Your delivery goes a long way in removing all these barriers to effective feedback.The goal: to make the feedback feel more constructive than critical.

您的交付在消除所有这些有效反馈的障碍方面大有帮助。目标：让反馈更具建设性，而不是批判性。

-   One way to do this is to **phrase it as a question**.Writer [Damilare Olasinde](https://www.clippings.me/users/damilareolasinde) has a client who regularly phrases his feedback as suggestions or questions.For example, one time, he commented with feedback to the effect of "Is this relevant? Why don't we go straight to discuss the three types of ABC and then include any insights from XYZ." Damilare says, "I find this tactic effective because it delivers his criticism without damaging my confidence.It also allows me to clarify any misinterpretations and share my reason for specific actions."
    一种方法是将其表述为一个问题。作家Damilare Olasinde有一个客户，他经常将他的反馈表述为建议或问题。例如，有一次，他用反馈评论说：“这相关吗？我们为什么不直接讨论三种类型的ABC，然后包括XYZ的任何见解。达米拉尔说：“我发现这种策略很有效，因为它在不损害我的信心的情况下传达了他的批评。它还允许我澄清任何误解并分享我采取具体行动的原因。

-   Another tactic: **balancing negative feedback with positive feedback**.When Lindsay Davis from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) looked for a job, one interviewer's feedback stuck."The interviewer didn't solely focus on my weaknesses," Lindsay says."She pointed out my strengths and told me how I can align them with my future career choices.And that's worked because it let me know that focusing on my strengths and embracing who I am is sometimes a better strategy than a never-ending struggle with weaknesses."
    另一种策略：平衡负面反馈和正面反馈。当Icons8的Lindsay Davis找工作时，一位面试官的反馈卡住了。“面试官不仅仅关注我的弱点，”林赛说。“她指出了我的优势，并告诉我如何将它们与我未来的职业选择结合起来。这奏效了，因为它让我知道，专注于自己的优势并拥抱我是谁有时比与弱点永无止境的斗争更好。

-   When you *do* need to focus more on negative aspects than positive aspects, you can balance your delivery by maintaining a **neutral tone**.Product launch consultant [Ken Savage](https://kensavage.com/) recounts, "I once received feedback about negativity in the workplace, and though it would be easy to take this kind of feedback personally, the person did an excellent job at explaining the situation from a neutral point of view.\[I\] was able to see the situation as it is and very quickly act on the feedback and make sure the mistake never happened again."
    当您确实需要更多地关注消极方面而不是积极方面时，您可以通过保持中立的语气来平衡您的交付。产品发布顾问肯·萨维奇（Ken Savage）回忆说：“我曾经收到过关于工作场所消极情绪的反馈，虽然很容易将这种反馈视为个人，但这个人在从中立的角度解释情况方面做得非常出色。\[我\]能够看到情况的现状，并根据反馈迅速采取行动，并确保错误不再发生。

## 2\.Effective feedback sets recipients up for future success

2\.有效的反馈为未来的成功奠定了基础

In many situations where you give feedback—including the workplace—you might find yourself giving the same feedback over and over again. 

在你提供反馈的许多情况下（包括工作场所），你可能会发现自己一遍又一遍地给出相同的反馈。

You can mitigate this by delivering feedback that helps the person develop habits to succeed in the future—for both of your sakes.It also doesn't hurt that feedback focused on future actions (versus past performance) [is shown to be more effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304587/) because it removes the barriers to effective feedback I talked about earlier.

您可以通过提供反馈来缓解这种情况，帮助该人养成习惯以在未来取得成功——这对您来说都是为了您俩。专注于未来行动（相对于过去的表现）的反馈被证明更有效也没有什么坏处，因为它消除了我之前谈到的有效反馈的障碍。

Some of this process will depend on the structure of your and your recipient's jobs.In his article on giving designers feedback as a marketer, [Chris Gillespie at Fenwick](https://www.fenwick.media/all-blog-posts/marketers-guide-design-feedback-make-it-pop) emphasizes understanding how the design workflow works.Giving them organized feedback early in the design process sets them up for a successful design overall.

其中一些过程将取决于您和您的收件人的工作结构。泛伟的Chris Gillespie在他关于作为营销人员为设计师提供反馈的文章中强调了理解设计工作流程是如何工作的。在设计过程的早期为他们提供有组织的反馈，为他们的整体设计成功奠定基础。

> The best feedback is made with the goal of making future collaboration better in the long term.
> 最好的反馈是为了使未来的长期合作变得更好。

Rachel Go, Content Strategist

Rachel Go，内容策略师

Content strategist [Rachel Go](http://rachelandreago.com/) has found that the most effective feedback for her focuses on helping her improve as a writer, content marketer, and marketing director.She says:

内容策略师 Rachel Go 发现，对她最有效的反馈集中在帮助她提高作为作家、内容营销人员和营销总监的地位。她说：

> *"The best feedback is made with the goal of making future collaboration better in the long term.
> “最好的反馈是为了使未来的长期合作变得更好。*

> *As a writer, that meant feedback that was actionable, and my editors, instead of simply fixing my mistakes because it was quicker, explained why they want XYZ adjustments, and then let me do it to learn.In the short term, it makes the editing process longer, but in the long term, it meant fewer edits needed.
> 作为一名作家，这意味着反馈是可操作的，我的编辑不是简单地修复我的错误，因为它更快，而是解释了为什么他们想要XYZ调整，然后让我去做学习。在短期内，它使编辑过程更长，但从长远来看，这意味着需要更少的编辑。*

> *As a content marketing manager, good feedback from my marketing director came backed with statistics.I got feedback alongside metrics that directly related to the company's success, so I could see how my work affected revenue and other big KPIs.This feedback paired with concrete evidence helped drive home the importance of continuous improvement and how incremental changes turned into big wins.
> 作为一名内容营销经理，我的营销总监的良好反馈得到了统计数据的支持。我得到了反馈以及与公司成功直接相关的指标，因此我可以看到我的工作如何影响收入和其他重要的 KPI。这些反馈与具体证据相结合，有助于让人们认识到持续改进的重要性，以及渐进式变革如何转化为巨大的胜利。*

> *As a marketing director, good feedback from my founders usually comes in the form of how to be a better manager.Feedback feels more like conversations and brainstorming but with the goal of improving my effectiveness as a manager."
> 作为一名营销总监，我的创始人的良好反馈通常以如何成为一名更好的经理的形式出现。反馈感觉更像是对话和头脑风暴，但目标是提高我作为经理的效率。*

Consider the future impact of your feedback on your recipient's work.Does it offer information that will help them change their behavior in the future? If so, everyone wins.

考虑您的反馈对收件人工作的未来影响。它是否提供了有助于他们在未来改变行为的信息？如果是这样，每个人都赢了。

## 3\.Effective feedback comes from an empathetic place

3\.有效的反馈来自善解人意的地方

Effective feedback is a back-and-forth process.When you offer feedback, don't think of it as "correcting" what they're doing.Instead, focus on helping the other person and understanding their point of view.Even just switching your mindset from "that's wrong" to "[tell me more](https://zapier.com/blog/the-power-of-tell-me-more/)" can make a huge difference.

有效的反馈是一个来回的过程。当你提供反馈时，不要认为这是“纠正”他们正在做的事情。相反，专注于帮助对方并理解他们的观点。即使只是将你的心态从“那是错误的”转变为“告诉我更多”，也能产生巨大的影响。

For Kris Lippi of [ISoldMyHouse.com](https://www.isoldmyhouse.com/), one of the most valued times he received feedback involved someone truly dedicated to helping him.He created his company's previous website design and received a comment in an email about his brokerage's services that said: "I did have some issues using your website.I wish it was more user-friendly than it is now.If you have time, you can reply to this email and we can talk about some improvements your website can have."

对于 ISoldMyHouse.com 的克里斯·里皮（Kris Lippi）来说，他收到反馈的最有价值的时间之一是真正致力于帮助他的人。他创建了公司以前的网站设计，并在一封关于他的经纪公司服务的电子邮件中收到了一条评论，上面写着：“我确实在使用你的网站上遇到了一些问题。我希望它比现在更用户友好。如果您有时间，可以回复此电子邮件，我们可以讨论您的网站可以进行的一些改进。

When Kris responded to the email, the client walked him step-by-step through his feedback, which he found incredibly valuable."What made it effective feedback for me is the client's willingness to help me out.It only shows how much they value what I can give to them, and they want my company to help others the way we helped them," Kris explains.

当Kris回复电子邮件时，客户一步一步地向他介绍了他的反馈，他发现这些反馈非常有价值。“对我来说，有效的反馈是客户愿意帮助我。这只表明他们多么重视我能给他们的东西，他们希望我的公司像我们帮助他们一样帮助他人，“克里斯解释道。

## 4\.Effective feedback shares your opinion (when warranted)

4\.有效的反馈分享您的意见（必要时）

[Jennifer Porter](https://hbr.org/2017/10/how-to-give-feedback-people-can-actually-use) values feedback based on facts over opinion.That's solid advice when that opinion is about the *person*.But if your recipient is facing a problem with multiple possible solutions, your opinion on the situation can offer them a new angle to work with.

詹妮弗·波特（Jennifer Porter）重视基于事实而不是意见的反馈。当这个意见是关于这个人时，这是可靠的建议。但是，如果您的收件人面临多种可能的解决方案的问题，您对情况的看法可以为他们提供一个新的工作角度。

> Getting good feedback, in my opinion, means seeing the same problem but from different angles and perspectives.
> 在我看来，获得良好的反馈意味着从不同的角度和角度看待相同的问题。

George Makkoulis, Keragon

乔治·马库利斯， 喀拉贡

When George Makkoulis performed the initial market discovery for his healthcare startup, [Keragon](https://www.keragon.com/), the 300+ industry experts he talked to had a wide range of opinions on the American healthcare market.While some discouraged him from starting a business in the industry altogether, others saw a lot of opportunity:

当George Makkoulis为他的医疗保健初创公司Keragon进行最初的市场发现时，他与之交谈的300 +行业专家对美国医疗保健市场有广泛的意见。虽然有些人不鼓励他完全在这个行业创业，但其他人看到了很多机会：

> "At the beginning, this was overwhelming.But then I quickly realized that this is some of the best feedback I could receive.I then changed my frame of mind and realized that everyone had their own perspective and they were helping me understand a very complex space from different angles.So then, at follow-up discussions, I was asking many 'whys?' and trying to unravel the different angles."
> “一开始，这是压倒性的。但后来我很快意识到，这是我能收到的最好的反馈。然后我改变了我的心态，意识到每个人都有自己的观点，他们正在帮助我从不同的角度理解一个非常复杂的空间。因此，在后续讨论中，我问了很多'为什么？'，并试图解开不同的角度。

For George, these discussions were foundational in building Keragon.Some of his favorite feedback is opinionated."Everyone has their own opinion and their own biases.Including myself.Getting good feedback, in my opinion, means seeing the same problem but from different angles and perspectives," he says.

对于乔治来说，这些讨论是建造Keragon的基础。他最喜欢的一些反馈是固执己见的。“每个人都有自己的观点和偏见。包括我自己。在我看来，获得良好的反馈意味着从不同的角度和角度看待同样的问题，“他说。

You have a unique perspective.As long as you're empathetic and constructive, that viewpoint will give the person receiving your feedback a new angle to work with.

你有一个独特的视角。只要你善解人意和建设性，这种观点就会给接收你反馈的人一个新的工作角度。

## 5\.Effective feedback is specific and actionable

5\.有效的反馈是具体和可操作的

Effective feedback offers specific examples and solutions, so the person you're giving feedback to knows what to do to improve.Knowing exactly what they did that they can improve on—and what actions to take to improve—helps recipients actually apply feedback.

有效的反馈提供了具体的例子和解决方案，因此您提供反馈的人知道该怎么做才能改进。确切地知道他们做了什么可以改进，以及采取什么措施来改进，有助于接受者实际应用反馈。

In an [interview with CNBC](http://cnbc.com/2022/05/17/the-right-way-to-give-constructive-feedback-at-work-it-should-always-come-from-a-place-of-caring.html), a TopResume career expert recommends providing examples and solutions in a caring manner to empower someone to improve.She differentiates "constructive" feedback from "destructive" feedback based on specificity. 
在接受CNBC采访时，TopResume职业专家建议以关怀的方式提供示例和解决方案，以增强某人的能力。她根据特异性区分“建设性”反馈和“破坏性”反馈。

-   **Constructive feedback** provides specific examples of the mistakes the person made and follows up with suggestions for improvement.
    建设性反馈提供了该人所犯错误的具体示例，并跟进改进建议。

-   **Destructive feedback** involves broad and purely negative statements.
    破坏性反馈涉及广泛和纯粹的负面陈述。

Katie Bray from [Flying Cat Marketing](http://flyingcatmarketing.com/) breaks down what made one instance of feedback specific and actionable for her:
来自Flying Cat Marketing的Katie Bray分解了是什么使一个反馈实例对她来说是具体和可操作的：

> *"1.They asked if they could give me the feedback.We weren't already in conversation, so it was coming out of the blue.This made sure I was ready to listen and also made me feel like they cared if I cared and weren't just trying to push their opinion on me (e.g., 'Can I give you some feedback about your presentation?')
> “1.他们问他们是否可以给我反馈。我们还没有进行对话，所以它是突然出现的。这确保了我准备好倾听，也让我觉得他们关心我是否关心，而不仅仅是试图将他们的意见强加给我（例如，“我可以给你一些关于你的演讲的反馈吗？*

> *2\.They mentioned a specific behavior.They stated facts and not their thoughts.(e.g., 'The first slide was full of words and diagrams.')
> 2.他们提到了一种特定的行为。他们陈述的是事实，而不是他们的想法。（例如，“第一张幻灯片充满了文字和图表。*

> *3\.They stated why that had an impact.(e.g., 'It was difficult to read the slide and listen to you at the same time.It's easy to get distracted if there's so much info to look at on the screen and also try to listen to everything you're saying')
> 3\.他们说明了为什么这会产生影响。（例如，“很难同时阅读幻灯片和听你说话。如果屏幕上有太多信息要看，并且还尝试倾听您所说的一切，则很容易分心。*

> *4\.They offered a solution.(e.g., 'I find it more effective when I only have a headline or one diagram on each slide, and the rest I can explain in words and I know I have everyone's full attention.')
> 4\.他们提供了一个解决方案。（例如，“当我在每张幻灯片上只有一个标题或一个图表时，我发现它更有效，其余的我可以用语言解释，我知道我得到了每个人的全部注意力。*

> *5\.They checked in with how I received that.(e.g., 'What do you think? Can you see how it might have been too much information?')"
> 5.他们检查了我是如何收到的。（例如，“你怎么看？你能看出它可能是太多的信息吗？'）”*

Notice that one of these steps was providing a solution, which Elizabeth Pharo of [Divorce.com](https://divorce.com/) also agrees is a characteristic of effective feedback.When her company released a new feature, one user shared an issue he had with it."He pinpointed the problem—the feature couldn't track case progress accurately, causing user frustration," Elizabeth says.
请注意，其中一个步骤是提供解决方案，Divorce.com 的Elizabeth Pharo也同意这是有效反馈的特征。当她的公司发布一项新功能时，一位用户分享了他遇到的一个问题。“他指出了问题所在——该功能无法准确跟踪案件进度，导致用户感到沮丧，”伊丽莎白说。

"What stood out in his feedback was his solution—a straightforward but effective concept of adding a visual timeline.His idea tackled the problem directly and provided a solution that would improve the user experience," she explains.
“在他的反馈中脱颖而出的是他的解决方案 - 一个简单但有效的概念，即添加视觉时间线。他的想法直接解决了这个问题，并提供了一个可以改善用户体验的解决方案，“她解释道。

## Effective feedback requires trust and vulnerability

有效的反馈需要信任和脆弱性

What makes my roommate and me able to give each other candid feedback about our food is the same thing that makes each of these tips so helpful: good feedback acknowledges the trust and vulnerability that goes into the process through good-faith communication and the drive to help another person.Be transparent and kind, and your feedback will go much further.
是什么让我和我的室友能够就我们的食物给予对方坦率的反馈，正是这些技巧中的每一个都如此有帮助的原因：良好的反馈承认通过真诚的沟通和帮助他人的动力进入过程中的信任和脆弱性。保持透明和友善，您的反馈将走得更远。
