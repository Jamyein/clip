There are twenty-five words typed on the card on the wall, five rows of five, all nouns: “Ball,” “Tree,” “Dog,” etc. I read the words out loud one by one, first unaccompanied, then along with a metronome at 80 beats per minute, then again at 100. I read the first and the last word of each line at 80, then the second and the second-to-last. Now I hold an identical card and read all twenty-five words, alternating between the card in my hand and the card on the wall. At 80. At 100. I read the first word of each line on the card in my hand and the last on the card on the wall. At 100. Again, backward. I read the words on the card on the wall along with the metronome standing on a mat that throws my feet off balance. Now I focus my vision on the word in the center of the card on the wall: “Dog.” I shake my head back and forth along with the metronome, at 80 beats per minute. Dog. Dog. Dog. The tempo increases to 100 again. The word comes in and out of focus. Dog. Dog. Dog. Thirty seconds. Finally, I stop. I sit down and close my eyes.  
墙上的卡片上打着二十五个字，五行五个，都是名词：“球”、“树”、“狗”等。我一个接一个地大声朗读这些单词，首先是无人伴奏，然后是节拍器，每分钟 80 次，然后是 100 次。我在 80 时阅读了每行的第一个和最后一个单词，然后是第二个和倒数第二个单词。现在我拿着一张相同的卡片，读完所有二十五个字，在我手中的卡片和墙上的卡片之间交替。80岁。在100。我读了手里卡片上每行的第一个字，墙上的卡片上最后一个字。在100。再次，落后。我读到墙上卡片上的字，以及站在垫子上的节拍器，这让我的脚失去了平衡。现在，我将视线集中在墙上卡片中央的单词上：“狗”。我随着节拍器来回摇头，每分钟80次。狗。狗。狗。节奏再次增加到100。这个词进进出出焦点。狗。狗。狗。三十秒。最后，我停下来。我坐下来，闭上眼睛。

The purpose of vestibular therapy is to induce symptoms of dizziness so that the brain becomes accustomed to accommodating them until they subside or are no longer noticeable. It’s a kind of physical therapy designed to train and improve the functioning of the vestibular system —the inner ear—which determines a body’s balance and stable position in space. Dysfunction of the vestibular system can result in a range of complications, from vertigo to ataxia to double vision. I’m currently receiving treatment for convergence insufficiency, a slight misalignment or tendency to turn outward of one eye (my left), and Persistent Postural Perceptual Dizziness, a chronic “non-spinning” dizziness that causes disorientation and foggy thinking without necessarily impeding physical balance. My symptoms are constant, but interfere mostly with visual processing—usually when I’m reading, particularly on a screen, or when I’m in a busy public place.  
前庭治疗的目的是诱发头晕症状，使大脑习惯于适应它们，直到它们消退或不再明显。这是一种物理疗法，旨在训练和改善前庭系统（内耳）的功能，该系统决定了身体在空间中的平衡和稳定位置。前庭系统功能障碍可导致一系列并发症，从眩晕到共济失调再到复视。我目前正在接受治疗收敛功能不全、一只眼睛（我的左眼）轻微错位或向外翻的倾向，以及持续姿势知觉头晕，这是一种慢性的“非旋转”头晕，会导致迷失方向和模糊思维，而不一定会妨碍身体平衡。我的症状是持续的，但主要干扰视觉处理 - 通常是当我阅读时，特别是在屏幕上，或者当我在繁忙的公共场所时。

Eliciting these diagnoses turned out to be far from easy. That surprised me, but not anyone I know who deals with doctors on a regular basis. No one has offered a definitive opinion about the cause of the symptoms, but more than one doctor has suggested that my mostly asymptomatic Delta-era Covid case left me with lingering inflammation in various parts of my body, which I may have exacerbated by freely indulging various habits I now recognize as inflammatory, like eating a high-carb diet, drinking coffee regularly and alcohol “socially,” and a couple of others I’ll elide here as “etc.” Apparently inflammation, like everything else, is a spectrum, always occurring to some degree, at lower levels in those who can tolerate austere wellness regimens like ketogenic diets and high-intensity interval training and far higher levels in those bedridden by chronic autoimmune diseases. I’ve since ceased all of my various inflammatory habits, which I’m told amounts to a lifestyle change, because a spectrum must also describe a lifestyle.  
事实证明，引出这些诊断远非易事。这让我感到惊讶，但我认识的任何人都没有经常与医生打交道。没有人对症状的原因提出明确的意见，但不止一位医生建议，我大部分无症状的 Delta 时代 Covid 病例让我身体各个部位都挥之不去的炎症，我可能因自由放纵我现在认为是炎症的各种习惯而加剧了炎症，比如吃高碳水化合物饮食， 经常喝咖啡和“社交”喝酒，还有一些我在这里省略为“等”。显然，炎症和其他一切一样，是一个谱系，总是在某种程度上发生，在那些能够忍受生酮饮食和高强度间歇训练等严峻健康方案的人中处于较低水平，而在那些因慢性自身免疫性疾病而卧床不起的人中水平要高得多。从那以后，我停止了所有的各种炎症习惯，我被告知这相当于生活方式的改变，因为光谱也必须描述一种生活方式。

I often use the term “long Covid” to explain the above to friends I haven’t seen in a while, or to acquaintances who rarely encounter a person who doesn’t drink. The doctors I see rarely use this term. In America, doctors treat individuals, not crises of public health, which means patients must seek care as individuals rather than collectively, as members of a population. In any case, right now I’m in treatment not for long Covid but for a specific set of symptoms local to my vestibular system. The measures I’m taking to reduce rheumatic inflammation are mostly based on non-specific recommendations from doctors with unrelated specialties and anecdotal reports from people trying to recover from long Covid at home using various alternative remedies, from multivitamins to infrared light therapy.  
我经常用“长期新冠病毒”这个词来向我有一段时间没见的朋友，或者向很少遇到不喝酒的人的熟人解释上述内容。我看的医生很少使用这个词。在美国，医生治疗的是个人，而不是公共卫生危机，这意味着患者必须作为个人而不是集体，作为人口的一员寻求护理。无论如何，现在我接受的治疗不是长期的 Covid，而是针对我的前庭系统局部的一组特定症状。我为减少风湿性炎症而采取的措施主要基于不相关专业的医生的非具体建议，以及试图在家中使用各种替代疗法（从多种维生素到红外光疗法）从长期 Covid 中恢复过来的人的轶事报告。

After several months with these symptoms, I put on hold all of the various writing projects I had started or assured editors I would start when I still felt well. Keeping my gaze steady while scanning a page of text was hard enough that reading was no longer something I could do without depleting a significant amount of energy, which made maintaining a practice as a literary critic close to impossible, especially when my day job already required reading and writing on a computer screen. I was just becoming accustomed enough to the symptoms to be able to manage them when my neurologist finally referred me to a vestibular therapist. The next day, I received a publicity email from New Directions about a forthcoming translation of *Mild Vertigo*, a cult novel by the Japanese writer Mieko Kanai, about “the dizzying reality of being unable to locate oneself in the endless stream of minutiae that forms a lonely life.”  
在出现这些症状几个月后，我搁置了我开始的所有各种写作项目，或者向编辑保证我会在我感觉良好的时候开始。在扫描一页文本时保持视线稳定已经足够困难了，以至于阅读不再是我无法在不消耗大量精力的情况下完成的事情，这使得保持文学评论家的实践几乎是不可能的，尤其是当我的日常工作已经需要在电脑屏幕上阅读和写作时。当我的神经科医生最终将我转介给前庭治疗师时，我刚刚习惯了这些症状，以便能够控制它们。第二天，我收到了一封来自New Direction的宣传邮件，内容是日本作家金井美惠子（Mieko Kanai）的邪教小说《轻度眩晕》（Mild Vertigo）即将翻译，内容是“无法在形成孤独生活的无穷无尽的细节中找到自己的令人眼花缭乱的现实”。

*Mild Vertigo* follows Natsumi, a middle-class housewife in turn-of-the-millennium Tokyo, in looping, third-person, pages-long sentences that would be hard to easily digest even without a reading impairment. Natsumi has two young sons and a husband with a blithe and acerbic manner, the three of whom come and go like background noise as Natsumi observes a low-key but hardly effortless existence, visiting with her next-door neighbor, meeting her old girlfriends for dinner, and attempting to flirt with a younger man. The content of the novel is mostly made up of the details that populate a relatively comfortable urban life: laundry, newspapers, domesticated animals, money, food. Narratively stagnant by design, the text generates urgency and momentum by recreating the experience, recognizable to most people, of constant motion and total immersion in information communicated by an overabundance of visual signifiers. The only recurring narrative development that gives the novel its structure is the bouts of dizziness that strike Natsumi at moments of psychic significance.  
《轻度眩晕》讲述了千禧年之交东京的中产阶级家庭主妇夏美（Natsumi）循环播放的第三人称、长达数页的句子，即使没有阅读障碍，也很难轻易消化。夏美有两个年幼的儿子和一个丈夫，举止轻快而尖刻，他们三个人像背景噪音一样来来去去，夏美观察着低调但几乎不费吹灰之力的生活，拜访隔壁邻居，与她的旧女友共进晚餐，并试图与一个年轻的男人调情。小说的内容主要由相对舒适的城市生活的细节组成：洗衣房、报纸、家养动物、金钱、食物。文本在设计上停滞不前，通过重现大多数人都能识别的体验来产生紧迫感和动力，即不断运动并完全沉浸在过多的视觉符号传达的信息中。赋予小说结构的唯一反复出现的叙事发展是在具有精神意义的时刻袭击夏美的头晕目眩。

The nature of Natsumi’s dizziness is never made quite clear; the words Kanai uses to refer to Natsumi’s symptoms continually change, and their connotations are different every time. The word “vertigo” only appears twice in the text of the novel: once in an essay Natsumi reads about a book of photographs of crowds by the Japanese artist Kineo Kuwabara, and once at the end of the last chapter, when, while on the train, Natsumi visualizes the aisles at her grocery store from memory. In several other instances, Natsumi begins to feel “dizzy,” or describes this feeling herself: when she is in the bathtub imagining an affair between her husband and another woman (“she felt her head growing hazy, despite lying down she began to feel quite dizzy, and it was hard to say whether it was her whole body or just her field of vision”), when she explains the feeling of déja vu to her friend Setchan (“when you become an adult, especially a housewife, you have this feeling of *déja vu* that leaves you nauseous and dizzy”), and while she is watching the tap water stream out of the faucet into her kitchen sink. The tap water—more mundane domestic infrastructure—is especially activating for Natsumi, inducing dizziness twice: the first time it leaves her in “a kind of trance,” and later, watching it flow, she becomes dizzy and her head begins to “spin.”  
夏美头晕的性质从未完全清楚;金井用来指代夏美症状的词不断变化，每次的内涵都不同。“眩晕”这个词在小说的正文中只出现了两次：一次是在夏美读到日本艺术家桑原纪夫的一本关于人群照片的散文中，一次是在最后一章的结尾，当时夏美在火车上凭记忆想象了杂货店的过道。在其他几个例子中，夏美开始感到“头晕”，或者自己描述了这种感觉：当她在浴缸里想象丈夫和另一个女人之间的婚外情时（“她觉得自己的头越来越朦胧，尽管躺下了，但她开始感到头晕，很难说这是她的整个身体还是只是她的视野”）， 当她向她的朋友Setchan解释似曾相识的感觉时（“当你成年后，尤其是家庭主妇，你会有一种似曾相识的感觉，让你恶心和头晕”），当她看着自来水从水龙头流出进入她的厨房水槽时。自来水——更平凡的家庭基础设施——对夏美来说尤其活跃，两次引起头晕：第一次它让她处于“一种恍惚”状态，后来，看着它流动，她变得头晕目眩，她的头开始“旋转”。

From what my doctors have told me, the extent to which dizziness is a physical rather than a mental phenomenon seems to be somewhat nebulous. While balance depends on physical factors like binocular alignment and levels of fluid in the aural canals, the sensations associated with dizziness depend largely on one’s perception of one’s position, or how the brain interprets what the inner ear determines. The inner ear calculates where you are and whether you’re moving, but the brain decides where it thinks you are and whether it thinks you’re moving, and they don’t always agree. In the novel, this distance between position and sensation expands to philosophical proportions. When Natsumi tells Setchan that déja vu “leaves you nauseous and dizzy,” she is really talking about dislocation—in this case in time, which is essentially an existential confusion. Similarly, when she drifts into a reverie in the bathtub and imagines that her husband is having an affair, working herself up until she begins to worry that his lover would judge her for not washing his underwear properly, she is thinking herself into a reverie that metaphysically transports her. In contemporary lingo, this kind of anxious dissociating into fantasy is appropriately known as “spiraling.”  
从我的医生告诉我的情况来看，头晕在多大程度上是一种身体现象而不是精神现象似乎有些模糊。虽然平衡取决于身体因素，如双眼对齐和耳道中的液位，但与头晕相关的感觉在很大程度上取决于一个人对自己位置的感知，或者大脑如何解释内耳决定的内容。内耳计算你在哪里，你是否在移动，但大脑决定它认为你在哪里，是否认为你在移动，他们并不总是同意。在小说中，这种位置和感觉之间的距离扩展到哲学上的比例。当夏美告诉Setsumi似曾相识“让你恶心和头晕”时，她实际上是在谈论错位——在这种情况下，时间，本质上是一种存在主义的混乱。同样，当她在浴缸里陷入遐想，想象丈夫有外遇，努力工作，直到她开始担心他的情人会因为没有好好洗内衣而评判她时，她认为自己陷入了形而上学的遐想。在当代术语中，这种焦虑与幻想的分离被恰当地称为“螺旋”。

A “trance” (a word that shares a root with “transport”) is its own kind of dislocation, or removal: a retreat from the here and now of one’s immediate external world into a dimension of pure presence. When Natsumi sees the water falling from the faucet, she finds herself “simply staring at it, as if she were being drawn into its motion . . . incapable of turning off the tap.” She asks her husband if he ever finds that in the middle of doing something he starts to “zone out.” The water at first hypnotizes Natsumi, and then makes her dizzy; her fixation on its movement can initiate either harmony or tension. Dizziness takes on a possible spiritual dimension. “There was nothing remarkable about it whatsoever, it was an utterly ordinary thing,” Natsumi muses when she sees the tap water, “and yet for some unknown reason she kept staring at it.” The constant motion of the restless mind and body can cause considerable distress, but maybe it can also, occasionally, open one to transcendence.  
“恍惚”（一个与“运输”共享词根的词）是它自己的错位或移除：从此时此地的直接外部世界撤退到一个纯粹存在的维度。当夏美看到水从水龙头掉下来时，她发现自己“只是盯着它，好像她被它的运动所吸引......无法关掉水龙头。她问她的丈夫，他是否发现在做某事的过程中，他开始“分区”。水先是催眠夏美，然后让她头晕目眩;她对运动的执着可以引发和谐或紧张。头晕具有可能的精神层面。“这没什么了不起的，这是一件非常普通的事情，”夏美看到自来水时沉思道，“然而不知什么原因，她一直盯着它看。躁动的身心的不断运动会造成相当大的痛苦，但也许它偶尔也会让人走向超越。

Public spaces pose more difficulty in this regard. On busy streets, crowds of moving bodies are not easy to navigate, even for people with all of their faculties intact. In Kuwabara’s photographs, according to the author of the essay Natsumi reads, “all the adults, children, and women who here appear detached from the narratives of their own private lives and histories . . . this all leaves the viewer with a sensation similar to a kind of vertigo.” Vertigo: the word is introduced when what the viewer sees is so complex that it becomes too much to interpret at once. There is too much activity, which is physically confusing, and there are also too many other conscious individuals, which is existentially confusing as well. The sensing body and the feeling temperament are both overloaded. Natsumi’s life in a densely populated and economically deregulated metropolis is one dominated by these physical and existential multiplicities.  
公共空间在这方面带来了更大的困难。在繁忙的街道上，成群结队的移动尸体不容易导航，即使对于所有能力都完好无损的人来说也是如此。根据文章作者夏美（Natsumi）所说，在桑原的照片中，“这里所有似乎脱离了自己私生活和历史叙事的成年人、儿童和妇女......这一切都给观众留下了一种类似于眩晕的感觉。眩晕：当观众看到的东西如此复杂以至于无法立即解释时，就会引入这个词。有太多的活动，这在身体上是混乱的，也有太多其他有意识的个体，这在存在上也是令人困惑的。感应体和感觉气质都超负荷了。夏美生活在一个人口稠密、经济放松管制的大都市，被这些物质和存在的多样性所支配。

Which brings us to the supermarket. In the supermarket of the pop-postmodern novel and poppier retro-pomo movie *White Noise*, “Everything is concealed in symbolism, hidden by veils of mystery and layers of cultural material.” In the drugstores and shopping centers of Jean Baudrillard’s *The Consumer Society*, “this metonymic, repetitive discourse of consumable matter, of the commodity, becomes once again, through a great collective metaphor––by virtue of its very excess––the image of the gift.” The supermarket is such a locus of Natsumi’s life that more than once in the novel she lists in her head the exact same series of products displayed there for sale (“. . . raw squid, lightly salted cod, Alaska pollock, fresh salmon fillets, rose fish fillets, sardines, horse mackerel, small horse mackerel for deep frying, smelt for deep frying, scallops for cooking with, steamed scallops, and scabbard fish fillets . . .”), until more than three pages have accumulated. The entirety of the supermarket is imprinted on her memory. She need only close her eyes, and she is there. Why, exactly, does this routine mental exercise make her physically sick?  
这就把我们带到了超市。在流行后现代小说和流行复古波莫电影《白噪声》的超市里，“一切都隐藏在象征主义中，被神秘的面纱和文化物质的层层所掩盖。在让·鲍德里亚（Jean Baudrillard）的《消费社会》（The Consumer Society）的药店和购物中心里，“这种关于消费品、商品的重复性话语，通过一个伟大的集体隐喻——由于其过度——再次成为礼物的形象。超市是夏美生活的中心，以至于在小说中，她不止一次地在脑海中列出了那里展示的完全相同的待售产品系列（“......生鱿鱼、淡盐鳕鱼、阿拉斯加狭鳕、新鲜鲑鱼片、玫瑰鱼片、沙丁鱼、竹荚鱼、油炸小竹荚鱼、油炸香瓜鱼、做饭用扇贝、蒸扇贝、刀鞘鱼片......“），直到积累了三页以上。整个超市都烙印在她的记忆中。她只需要闭上眼睛，她就在那里。究竟为什么这种例行的心理锻炼会让她身体不适？

At home, I write the word “dog” on an envelope in pen and stand it up on top of my bookcase. I set the metronome to 90 beats per minute and shake my head back and forth. Dog. Dog. Dog. I’m reminded of a joke my father used to tell me, a joke I later discovered he lifted from *Infinite Jest*: What is a dyslexic agnostic insomniac? Someone who stays up all night wondering if there is a dog. I hold my hands out in front of me, raise my two index fingers, set the metronome to 90 again, and look back and forth from the left hand to the right, twenty times. I complete five sets of twenty, then do the same with one finger raised above my head and one held down several feet below it. Eventually I move on to reading numbers on a line spanning from one to twenty, starting at one, jumping to twenty, to two, to nineteen, and so on, first with only my left eye, then with only my right. Then I jump between two lines, from one to one, two to two, et cetera.  
在家里，我用笔在信封上写下“狗”这个词，然后把它放在书柜上。我将节拍器设置为每分钟 90 次，并来回摇头。狗。狗。狗。我想起了我父亲曾经给我讲的一个笑话，后来我发现他从《无限玩笑》中解脱出来的一个笑话：什么是阅读障碍不可知论失眠症？有人熬夜想知道是否有狗。我把手伸到身前，竖起两根食指，再次将节拍器调到90，从左手到右手来回看，二十次。我完成了五组二十，然后做同样的事情，一根手指举过头顶，一根手指放在头下几英尺处。最终，我继续阅读从一到二十的线上的数字，从一开始，跳到二十，到二，到十九，依此类推，首先只用左眼，然后只用右眼。然后我在两条线之间跳跃，从一到一，从二到二，等等。

The French opthalmologist Emile Javal introduced the term *saccade*, from the French for “jerk,” as the clinical term for quick movements of the eyes from one focal point to another. Javal took notice of saccadic movement while observing patients’ eyes as they read lines of text. His most famous paper concerns the physiology of reading, which he considers the most fatiguing activity that the eyes perform on a regular basis, and a possible cause of myopia. Reading probably requires the most systematic and repetitive saccadic movements, but the eyes are always jumping from point to point at instantaneous speeds. When we walk down a busy street, we take notice of every passing pedestrian, every street sign or traffic light, every approaching car. When we shop for groceries at the supermarket, we scan up and down every aisle for the right item, the right brand, the right price, dozens of times before we’re ready to check out, usually dodging however many other scanning shoppers as we go. DeLillo plays as a joke that full professors at the college in *White Noise* “read nothing but cereal boxes,” but stand in the middle of an aisle fully stocked with them and these boxes, with their dozens of brand names, each with its own extended universe of marketing copy and history of federal regulation and review, undeniably constitute a corpus. I’ve had an equally hard time shopping recently at supermarkets and at bookstores.  
法国眼科医生埃米尔·贾瓦尔（Emile Javal）引入了扫视（saccade）一词，该术语来自法语，意为“抽搐”，作为眼睛从一个焦点快速移动到另一个焦点的临床术语。Javal注意到扫视运动，同时观察患者阅读文本行时的眼睛。他最著名的论文涉及阅读的生理学，他认为这是眼睛经常进行的最疲劳的活动，也是近视的可能原因。阅读可能需要最系统和重复的扫视动作，但眼睛总是以瞬时的速度从一个点跳到另一个点。当我们走在繁忙的街道上时，我们会注意到每一个路过的行人，每一个路牌或交通信号灯，每一个驶来的汽车。当我们在超市购买杂货时，我们会在准备结账之前，在每个过道上上下扫描以寻找合适的商品、合适的品牌、合适的价格，通常会躲避许多其他扫描购物者。DeLillo开玩笑说，白噪声学院的正教授“只读麦片盒”，但站在过道中间，里面装满了麦片盒，这些盒子，有几十个品牌名称，每个盒子都有自己的营销文案和联邦监管和审查的历史， 不可否认地构成了一个语料库。我最近在超市和书店购物时也同样困难。

To accommodate the continuous flow of information our eyes transmit as they dart from one point to another, we develop cognitive models that codify and anticipate familiar visual arrangements. Words and phrases become recognizable by their shapes so that we don’t have to verify their spelling and syntax. (The phrase “Paris in the the Spring” is often used as a psychological test that demonstrates this phenomenon.) The layout of an environment like a supermarket becomes navigable by instinct. The brain prefers to work smarter, not harder, partly because depending on sensory perception for all awareness and decision-making would require superhuman effort and stamina. The brain is more than capable of prolonged heavy reading, but even if we’re named after one of the protagonists, we’re not supposed to read *Ulysses* every time we leave the house.  
为了适应我们的眼睛从一个点到另一个点时传递的连续信息流，我们开发了认知模型，以编纂和预测熟悉的视觉安排。单词和短语可以通过它们的形状来识别，这样我们就不必验证它们的拼写和语法。（“春天的巴黎”这句话经常被用作证明这种现象的心理测试。像超市这样的环境的布局可以通过本能导航。大脑更喜欢更聪明地工作，而不是更努力地工作，部分原因是依靠感官知觉进行所有意识和决策需要超人的努力和耐力。大脑能够长时间阅读大量书籍，但即使我们以主角之一的名字命名，我们也不应该每次离开家时都阅读《尤利西斯》。

Public spaces are not designed and planned to minimize their impact the systems we use to perceive them. (Baudrillard again: goods sold in stores “are always arranged to mark out directive paths, to orientate the purchasing impulse towards networks of objects in order to captivate that impulse and bring it, in keeping with its own logic, to the highest degree of commitment, to the limits of its economic potential.”) Supermarkets, city streets, and cities themselves are built to support commerce––the highway leads you from big box to big box, the bike lane from Trader Joe’s to Whole Foods, contactless payment in fiat or crypto is accepted just about everywhere, within walking distance of every exception there’s a bank or a bank kiosk or an ATM, and this might seem annoying if you weren’t hungry, but you are always hungry; what participating in that commerce does to people is our problem. Before I started *Mild Vertigo*, I imagined that Natsumi’s dizziness would feel like too heavy-handed a metaphor for me, that her experience wouldn’t ring true, but I can relate to her triggers and how they act on her. Not everyone responds to these triggers like Natsumi does, but sooner or later we all find ourselves rubbing our eyes on the couch, dizzy and worn out, wondering how we managed to get our shopping done.  
公共空间的设计和规划并不是为了尽量减少它们对我们用来感知它们的系统的影响。（鲍德里亚再次指出：商店里出售的商品“总是被安排成标出指令路径，将购买冲动导向物体网络，以便吸引这种冲动，并使其按照自己的逻辑，达到最高程度的承诺，达到其经济潜力的极限。超市、城市街道和城市本身就是为了支持商业而建造的——高速公路将您从一个大盒子带到另一个大盒子，从 Trader Joe's 到全食超市的自行车道，几乎到处都可以接受法定货币或加密货币的非接触式支付，在每个例外的步行距离内，有银行或银行售货亭或自动取款机， 如果你不饿，这可能看起来很烦人，但你总是饿;参与这种商业对人们的影响是我们的问题。在我开始轻度眩晕之前，我想象夏美的头晕对我来说是一个过于沉重的隐喻，她的经历听起来不真实，但我可以理解她的触发因素以及它们对她的作用。不是每个人都像夏美那样对这些触发因素做出反应，但迟早我们都发现自己在沙发上揉眼睛，头晕目眩，疲惫不堪，想知道我们如何设法完成购物。

For the moment, this frazzled state is more or less my baseline. I can bear all of these sensorially involved situations; I’m just unusually attuned to how much they suck. I’ve reassessed what I expect my daily life to look like in the short term, which hasn’t been so easy. Limiting visual input and its attendant mental fatigue requires a wholesale retraining of what has become a reflex system. I have to resist the urge to scroll endlessly, to play music every time I take a walk or tackle a chore, to watch TV with every meal, end every workday with a drink, read every time I take the subway. Aspirationally, I imagine myself working toward something more than just a year of rest and relaxation: I am, I think, returning to myself. I try to experience extended periods of inactivity and silence. I listen to full albums with my eyes closed. Instead of looking up a name or fact I can’t recall, I wait for it to surface in my memory. That I experience these as feats of endurance says something about the person I am, but illness is a part of a person, something a person’s body does. In a lot of cases, life makes this project impossible. I have to be online for work, I have to file my taxes, I always have to buy more groceries or do my laundry eventually. When it’s attainable, though, this private repose can bring a kind of relief.  
目前，这种疲惫的状态或多或少是我的基线。我可以忍受所有这些感官上涉及的情况;我只是异常地适应他们吸了多少。我重新评估了我期望的日常生活在短期内的样子，这并不容易。限制视觉输入及其伴随的精神疲劳需要对已经成为反射系统的东西进行大规模的再培训。我必须抵制无休止地滚动的冲动，每次散步或处理家务时播放音乐，每顿饭都看电视，每个工作日喝一杯结束，每次乘坐地铁时阅读。我理想地想象自己努力的不仅仅是一年的休息和放松：我认为，我正在回归自我。我试图体验长时间的不活动和沉默。我闭着眼睛听完整的专辑。我没有去查找一个我记不起来的名字或事实，而是等待它出现在我的记忆中。我把这些经验作为忍耐力的壮举，说明了我这个人，但疾病是一个人的一部分，一个人的身体所做的事情。在很多情况下，生活使这个项目变得不可能。我必须上网上班，我必须报税，我总是必须买更多的杂货或最终洗衣服。然而，当它可以实现时，这种私人休息可以带来一种解脱。

In a world in which a person is first and foremost an economic unit, attention, participation, and even reliable self-orientation comes at a cost. The same 20th-century canon that assigned so much semiotic importance to the supermarket also demonstrated that the broader network of markets of which we’re all unwitting agents prescribes our basic values and assumptions. With that whole network now online and in front of every eye wherever it goes, one is rarely if ever fully disconnected from its catechism, whether it comes in the form of a Superbowl ad or a viral tweet. I’ve started to think, or hope, that if vestibular dysfunction means a failure to locate oneself within this edifice, maybe it also means an opportunity to propose new assumptions, new values. Without the motion of so many other bodies jarring me into debilitating tension, eventually I should settle down into stillness. In the meantime, maybe I can conjure an assumption that’s wholly mine, a thought that confirms my being, a motion that harmonizes with my own, and hypnotize myself into presence.  
在一个一个人首先是一个经济单位的世界里，关注、参与，甚至可靠的自我取向都是有代价的。20世纪的经典赋予超市如此多的符号学重要性，也表明我们都是不知情的代理人的更广泛的市场网络规定了我们的基本价值观和假设。随着整个网络现在在线，无论走到哪里，人们都很少完全脱离其教理问答，无论是以超级碗广告还是病毒推文的形式出现。我开始思考，或者希望，如果前庭功能障碍意味着无法在这个大厦中找到自己，也许这也意味着提出新假设、新价值观的机会。没有那么多其他身体的运动使我陷入虚弱的紧张，最终我应该安定下来进入寂静。与此同时，也许我可以想象一个完全属于我的假设，一个确认我存在的想法，一个与我自己的动作相协调的动作，并将自己催眠到存在中。
