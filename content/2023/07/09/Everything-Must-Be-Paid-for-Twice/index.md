One financial lesson they should teach in school is that most of the things we buy have to be paid for twice.

他们应该在学校教授的一堂金融课是，我们购买的大多数东西都必须支付两次费用。

There’s the first price, usually paid in dollars, just to gain possession of the desired thing, whatever it is: a book, a budgeting app, a unicycle, a bundle of kale.

第一个价格通常以美元支付，只是为了获得想要的东西，无论它是什么：一本书、一个预算应用程序、一辆独轮车、一捆羽衣甘蓝。

But then, in order to make use of the thing, you must also pay a second price. This is the effort and initiative required to gain its benefits, and it can be much higher than the first price.

但是，为了使用这个东西，你还必须付出第二个代价。这是获得其收益所需要的努力和主动性，而且它可以比最初的价格高得多。

A new novel, for example, might require twenty dollars for its first price—and ten hours of dedicated reading time for its second. Only once the second price is being paid do you see any return on the first one. Paying only the first price is about the same as throwing money in the garbage.

例如，一本新小说的第一本书可能需要二十美元，而第二本书则需要十个小时的专门阅读时间。只有支付第二个价格后，您才能看到第一个价格的任何回报。只支付第一笔费用就相当于把钱扔进垃圾桶。

Likewise, after buying the budgeting app, you have to set it all up, and learn to use it habitually before it actually improves your financial life. With the unicycle, you have to endure the presumably painful beginner phase before you can cruise down the street. The kale must be de-veined, chopped, steamed, and chewed before it gives you any nourishment.

同样，购买预算应用程序后，您必须将其全部设置好，并学会习惯性地使用它，然后它才能真正改善您的财务生活。使用独轮车时，您必须先忍受可能会很痛苦的初学者阶段，然后才能在街上行驶。羽衣甘蓝必须先去脉、切碎、蒸熟并咀嚼，然后才能给你提供任何营养。

If you look around your home, you might notice many possessions for which you’ve paid the first price but not the second. Unused memberships, unread books, unplayed games, unknitted yarns.  

如果你环顾你的家，你可能会注意到许多财产你已经支付了第一个价格，但没有支付第二个价格。未使用的会员资格、未读的书籍、未玩的游戏、未编织的纱线。

I can’t know for sure, but I have the sense that in pre-consumer societies, there was less emphasis on paying first prices (i.e. getting things into your possession) and much more on paying second prices—doing the work necessary to use what you have, and becoming someone who always does. Imagine a plow, purchased for its features, but which never gets pulled through the earth.

我不能确定，但我有一种感觉，在前消费社会，人们不太重视支付第一价格（即让东西成为你的财产），而更多地强调支付第二价格——做使用所必需的工作。你所拥有的，并成为一个始终如此的人。想象一下，购买了一把犁，是因为它的功能，但它永远不会被拉入土壤。

The miracle of industrialization has reduced many first prices tremendously, but has also given us many more of them to consider paying. With all the wonderful toys on offer, almost nobody feels like they have quite enough money, enough acquisition power. When a person receives a windfall, they immediately think of more first prices they can now pay.

工业化的奇迹极大地降低了许多最初的价格，但也让我们考虑支付更多的价格。尽管有这么多精彩的玩具，但几乎没有人觉得自己有足够的钱、足够的购买能力。当一个人收到意外之财时，他们会立即想到他们现在可以支付的更多第一价格。

But no matter how many cool things you acquire, you don’t gain any more time or energy with which to pay their second prices—to use the gym membership, to read the unabridged classics, to make the ukulele sound good—and so their rewards remain unredeemed.

但无论你获得了多少很酷的东西，你都无法获得更多的时间或精力来支付他们的第二个价格——使用健身房会员资格，阅读未删节的经典作品，让尤克里里琴听起来很棒——所以他们的奖励仍未兑换。

I believe this is one reason our modern lifestyles can feel a little self-defeating sometimes. In our search for fulfillment, we keep paying first prices, creating a correspondingly enormous debt of unpaid second prices. Yet the rewards of any purchase – the reason we buy it at all — stay locked up until _both_ prices are paid.

我相信这就是我们的现代生活方式有时会感到有点弄巧成拙的原因之一。在我们寻求满足的过程中，我们不断支付第一价格，相应地产生了未支付的第二价格的巨大债务。然而，任何购买的奖励——我们购买它的原因——都会被锁定，直到支付完这两个价格。

For example, you can pick up _Moby-Dick_ for a dollar at a garage sale, but it’s a wasted dollar if you don’t subsequently pay a significant second price: sixteen hours of attending closely to long Victorian commentaries on whales and the men who hunt them. And you’ve got many more debts competing for those same sixteen hours — the more first prices you’ve paid alongside this garage sale dollar, the less you feel like you’ll ever have time to properly experience the legend of Captain Ahab, or do any other elective activities that require effort and initiative.

例如，你可以在旧货拍卖会上以一美元的价格买下《白鲸》，但如果你随后不支付第二个重要的价格，那就是浪费美元：花十六个小时密切关注维多利亚时代关于鲸鱼和鲸鱼的长篇评论。追捕他们。在同样的十六个小时里，你还有更多的债务在竞争——你在车库拍卖中支付的首价越多，你就越觉得自己没有时间好好体验亚哈船长的传奇，或者进行任何其他需要努力和主动性的选修活动。

This scarcity feeling creates one of the major side-effects of our insurmountable second-price debt: we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further.

这种稀缺感造成了我们无法克服的二价债务的主要副作用之一：我们本能地过度沉迷于娱乐和其他低二价的乐趣——手机应用程序、流媒体服务和加工食品——尽管它们的回报往往是只比什么都不做好一点点。这种东西之所以有吸引力，是因为它不需要付出什么努力（而且我们已经厌倦了为这么多第一价格而工作），但它会占用大量时间，进一步耗尽第二价格的预算。

The only solution I can think of is to consciously throw the switch the other way: avoid paying any more needless first prices, and set your lifestyle around paying certain second prices, so you can finally enjoy the long-promised prizes waiting in your bookshelf, storage room, and hard drive. This was my original intuition behind the [Depth Year](https://www.raptitude.com/2017/12/go-deeper-not-wider/) concept—to designate a whole year in which you stop acquiring more _ways to do_ cool things, and start doing the cool things in earnest.

我能想到的唯一解决办法就是有意识地将开关切换到另一个方向：避免支付更多不必要的第一价格，并将你的生活方式围绕支付某些第二价格，这样你终于可以享受书架上等待已久的奖品，储藏室和硬盘。这是我在“深度年”概念背后的最初直觉——指定一整年，在这一年里你不再获取更多做酷事的方法，而是开始认真做很酷的事。

Paying a second price, unpleasant as it sounds, is a process you can acquire a taste for, and when you do, it’s exhilarating. It’s like picking your way through unmapped wilderness – the going is slow and there’s lots to trip over, but it’s new territory the whole way, and after the initial discomfort you feel very alive. Then when you come out the other side, this new territory has become part of your usual range, and you’re tougher and more interesting.

支付第二个价格，虽然听起来令人不快，但却是一个你可以尝试的过程，当你这样做时，它是令人兴奋的。这就像在没有地图的荒野中选择一条路——前进的速度很慢，有很多东西要绊倒，但一路上都是新的领域，在最初的不适之后，你会感觉自己充满活力。然后当你从另一边出来时，这个新的领域就成为你平常活动范围的一部分，你会变得更强硬、更有趣。

Figuring out how to pay the second price isn’t hard. You just have to notice that moment you usually think about packing it in, and stay with it instead of doing something else.

弄清楚如何支付第二个价格并不难。你只需要注意到你通常考虑把它收起来的那一刻，并坚持下去，而不是做其他事情。

In other words, when you hit the weeds, you go into them instead of away. The awkward B major chord on the guitar – get your fingers in place anyway, and see if you can relax into the position just a bit more. The part where Ishmael goes on at length about historical whale drawings – try to understand why it matters to him. It is in these unfamiliar moments that the rewards appear.

换句话说，当你触及杂草时，你是进入它们而不是离开。吉他上尴尬的 B 大调和弦——无论如何，先把手指放在适当的位置，看看是否可以再放松一点。以实玛利详细讲述历史鲸鱼图画的部分——尝试理解为什么这对他很重要。正是在这些陌生的时刻，奖励才出现。
