原标题：Here’s Why You Stop Liking Someone When They Like You Back  HuffPost Life

Nicole Phillip, a 30-year-old social media strategist from Orlando, Florida, noticed a pattern in her dating life.

来自佛罗里达州奥兰多的30 岁社交媒体策略师妮可·菲利普 (Nicole Phillip) 注意到她约会生活中的一个模式。

“Before entering a relationship, I’m super quick to write people off,” she told HuffPost. “When someone is very interested in me, it’s a turnoff. I prefer slow burns because rapid romance activates my fight-or-fly, and I usually choose ‘fly.’”

“在建立关系之前，我很快就会把某人撇下，”她告诉《赫芬顿邮报》。 “当有人对我非常感兴趣时，我就会感到厌烦。我更喜欢缓慢的燃烧，因为快速的浪漫会激发我的战斗或飞行，我通常选择‘飞行’。”

It’s a common experience. You develop a crush on someone, but when they reciprocate, you quickly lose interest.

这是一种常见的经历。你迷恋某人，但当他们回报你时，你很快就会失去兴趣。

For Jaz Melody, 27, of Los Angeles, that feeling was palpable.

对于洛杉矶 27 岁的贾兹·梅洛迪 (Jaz Melody) 来说，这种感觉是显而易见的。

“Before I was able to heal the parts of me that rejected intimacy, I would heavily pursue romantic connections,” she said. “But once they began to get deeper, I could feel my body physically rejecting them.”

“在我能够治愈我拒绝亲密关系的部分之前，我会大力追求浪漫的联系，”她说。 “但一旦它们开始变得更深，我就能感觉到我的身体在物理上排斥它们。”

Through therapy, Phillip and Melody were able to identify that these behaviors stemmed from their attachment styles.

通过治疗，菲利普和梅洛迪发现这些行为源于他们的依恋风格。

“Attachment style” refers to the way a person relates to others in intimate and platonic relationships. Usually shaped by our relationships with our parents and early caregivers, attachment styles fall into four categories: secure, avoidant, anxious and disorganized.

“依恋风格”是指一个人在亲密和柏拉图式关系中与他人相处的方式。依恋风格通常由我们与父母和早期照顾者的关系决定，分为四类：安全型、回避型、焦虑型和混乱型。

A secure attachment style allows people to set boundaries and feel [stable, safe and satisfied](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships-communication/attachment-and-adult-relationships.htm) in their relationships. On the other hand, people with avoidant, anxious and disorganized attachment styles [don’t feel secure in relationships](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4845754/). They worry about trusting people, and they tend to prioritize independence. As a result, an insecure attachment style may make someone reluctant to enter a relationship — hence, that feeling of pulling away once feelings are reciprocated.

安全的依恋风格可以让人们设定界限，并在人际关系中感到稳定、安全和满意。另一方面，具有回避型、焦虑型和无组织依恋风格的人在人际关系中没有安全感。他们担心信任别人，并且倾向于优先考虑独立性。因此，不安全的依恋风格可能会让人不愿意进入一段关系——因此，一旦感情得到回报，就会有一种抽离的感觉。

It’s something [psychologist Shaurya Gahlawat](http://www.therapywithshaurya.com/) sees in her private practice all the time.

心理学家 Shaurya Gahlawat 在她的私人诊所中经常看到这种情况。

“We lose interest when we gain power, and when someone admits they like us, it is exactly what we feel,” Gahlawat said. “We give up on working hard and that is not challenging enough, so at times we feel, ‘I achieved this! What next?’”

“当我们获得权力时，我们就会失去兴趣，而当有人承认他们喜欢我们时，这正是我们的感受，”加拉瓦特说。 “我们放弃了努力工作，这还不够具有挑战性，所以有时我们会觉得，‘我做到了！接下来是什么？'”

A [2020 study by Southern Methodist University](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1002/per.2226) found that simply knowing your attachment style, and being aware of whatever anxious or avoidant qualities you may have, can help you become more secure in your relationships. (You can figure out your attachment style by [taking this quiz](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/attachment-styles-romantic-relationships_n_5b7aec01e4b018b93e965509).)

南卫理公会大学 2020 年的一项研究发现，只要了解自己的依恋风格，并意识到自己可能具有的任何焦虑或回避特质，就可以帮助您在人际关系中变得更加安全。 （您可以通过参加此测验来找出您的依恋风格。）

That was the case for Melody. “I realized that I experience both the anxious and the avoidant side of the attachment styles,” she said. “Once I read the description for disorganized attachment style, I felt like I saw myself and all my traits for the first time.”

梅洛迪的情况就是如此。 “我意识到我经历了依恋风格的焦虑和回避的一面，”她说。 “当我读到对杂乱依恋风格的描述时，我感觉我第一次看到了自己和我的所有特质。”

We asked experts about how insecure attachments might be hindering your relationships, and how to develop a secure attachment style moving forward.

我们向专家询问了不安全的依恋可能会如何阻碍您的人际关系，以及如何发展安全的依恋风格。

## **Insecure attachments in relationships

关系中不安全的依恋**

Anxious, avoidant and disorganized attachment styles overlap in some ways and differ in others. People with an **anxious attachment style** have high levels of anxiety prior to entering a relationship, and they tend to fear rejection.

焦虑型、回避型和混乱型依恋风格在某些方面有重叠，但在其他方面则有所不同。具有焦虑依恋风格的人在建立关系之前会感到高度焦虑，并且他们往往害怕被拒绝。

“An anxiously attached person may feel they will not do too well in the relationship, the relationship will not last, that they will not be good enough, or the person may lose interest in them later,” Gahlawat said.

加拉瓦特说：“一个焦虑依恋的人可能会觉得他们在这段关系中不会做得太好，这种关系不会持久，他们会不够好，或者这个人可能会在以后对他们失去兴趣。”

This may manifest in desiring “high levels of intimacy, often feeling worried about their partner’s feelings and seeking reassurance,” she said.

她说，这可能表现为渴望“高度的亲密感，经常担心伴侣的感受并寻求安慰”。

People who have an **avoidant attachment style** might have a [fear of commitment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4845754/), and might demonstrate a complete withdrawal from relationships. They might also crave independence and have a [strong sense of autonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6732807/). As a result, they try to distance themselves from other people to avoid frustration.

具有回避型依恋风格的人可能害怕承诺，并可能表现出完全退出人际关系。他们也可能渴望独立并有强烈的自主意识。因此，他们试图与其他人保持距离以避免沮丧。

“People with an avoidant attachment style may have difficulty with emotional intimacy and may be uncomfortable with the vulnerability that comes with admitting or receiving feelings,“ Gahlawat said. “If someone with an avoidant attachment style is confronted with someone else’s romantic feelings, they may instinctively withdraw or become hesitant to reciprocate due to their fear of being engulfed or losing their sense of autonomy.”

加拉瓦特说：“具有回避型依恋风格的人可能难以建立情感上的亲密关系，并且可能会对承认或接受感情所带来的脆弱性感到不舒服。” “如果具有回避型依恋风格的人面对别人的浪漫感情，他们可能会本能地退缩或犹豫是否要回应，因为他们害怕被吞噬或失去自主感。”

**Disorganized, or** [**dismissive and fearful attachment styles**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8852889/), are characterized by low levels of emotional vulnerability and intensity, little reliance on partners, and greater reluctance to share personal information.

无组织性或轻蔑和恐惧的依恋风格的特点是情感脆弱性和强度较低，对伴侣的依赖程度较低，并且更不愿意分享个人信息。

“Their behavior in relationships may be unpredictable and erratic,” [Christine Taylor](http://www.crosbycounselingllc.com/), a licensed professional counselor and relationship therapist, told HuffPost.

“他们在人际关系中的行为可能难以预测且反复无常，”持有执照的专业咨询师和关系治疗师克里斯蒂娜·泰勒告诉《赫芬顿邮报》。

People with this style “may exhibit both anxious and avoidant behaviors simultaneously or in rapid alternation,” Gahlawat said. “For example, they may seek proximity to their partner, but then abruptly withdraw or display aggressive or fearful reactions when they get close.”

加拉瓦特说，具有这种风格的人“可能会同时或快速交替地表现出焦虑和回避行为”。 “例如，他们可能会寻求与伴侣的亲近，但当他们靠近时却突然退缩或表现出攻击性或恐惧的反应。”

It’s important to note that various attachment styles can intertwine, and people might display different qualities and behaviors within their relationships.

值得注意的是，各种依恋风格可以交织在一起，人们在人际关系中可能会表现出不同的品质和行为。

“Attachment styles are not fixed or mutually exclusive categories,” Gahlawat said. “Individuals can exhibit varying degrees of both anxious and avoidant tendencies, and their attachment styles may vary in different relationships or contexts.”

“依恋风格并不是固定的或相互排斥的类别，”加拉瓦特说。 “个人可能表现出不同程度的焦虑和回避倾向，他们的依恋风格在不同的关系或环境中可能会有所不同。”

On the flip side, securely attached adults are able both to trust others and to be self-sufficient. They’re comfortable with intimacy, and are able to communicate boundaries in a relationship.

另一方面，安全型依恋的成年人既能够信任他人又能够自给自足。他们对亲密关系感到满意，并且能够沟通关系中的界限。

“They tend to bond easily with others and feel comfortable being vulnerable and close,” Taylor told HuffPost. “They are more trusting and are able to communicate their needs effectively.”

泰勒告诉《赫芬顿邮报》：“他们往往很容易与他人建立联系，并在脆弱和亲密的时候感到自在。” “他们更加信任他人，能够有效地传达自己的需求。”

## **How to develop secure attachments

如何开发安全附件**

If you notice a pattern of pulling away once someone likes you back, remember that these habits are not set in stone.

如果你注意到一旦有人喜欢你，你就会离开，请记住这些习惯并不是一成不变的。

“It’s important to note that attachment styles are not fixed or absolute traits; they can be influenced by various factors and can change over time with personal growth and experiences,” Gahlawat said. “Additionally, individual differences exist within attachment styles, and not all individuals with the same style will respond in the same way.”

“值得注意的是，依恋风格并不是固定的或绝对的特征；它们可能会受到各种因素的影响，并且会随着个人成长和经历的时间而改变，”Gahlawat 说。 “此外，依恋风格存在个体差异，并非所有具有相同风格的人都会以相同的方式做出反应。”

In order to create more secure attachments, it might be helpful to find a therapist, if you’re able, who can help you work through harmful behaviors like withdrawing from relationships, whether they’re intimate or platonic.

为了建立更安全的依恋关系，如果有能力的话，找一位治疗师可能会有所帮助，他可以帮助你解决有害行为，例如退出关系，无论是亲密关系还是柏拉图式关系。

“It is important to dig deep, reflect on your past to understand why you feel anxious, avoidant, and not secure,” Gahlawat said. “Processing your relationships as a child and teen are important to stay aware of what is about today, your current relationship, and what is baggage from the past.”

加拉瓦特说：“深入挖掘、反思你的过去，了解为什么你感到焦虑、回避和不安全，这一点很重要。” “在儿童和青少年时期处理人际关系非常重要，可以了解今天的情况、当前的关系以及过去的包袱。”

It may seem counterintuitive, but Gahlawat recommended discussing avoidant feelings with the person you’re seeing as they come up.

这可能看起来有悖常理，但加拉瓦特建议在回避情绪出现时与你所见的人讨论。

“Build trust gradually, be reliable, consistent and honest, because trust is the foundation of secure relationships,” she said. ”If you are feeling anxious, discuss with them. If you feel you’re moving too fast, talk about it.”
“逐渐建立信任，要可靠、一致和诚实，因为信任是安全关系的基础，”她说。 “如果您感到焦虑，请与他们讨论。如果你觉得自己进展得太快，那就谈谈吧。”

Additionally, asking yourself questions while you’re in a relationship can be helpful. Taylor suggested posing questions to yourself like: “Does the thought of being vulnerable with my partner make me anxious? Am I afraid to get too close emotionally? Do I tend to push my partner away? Do I get jealous easily? Do I need a lot of reassurance even when I know that my partner loves me?”

此外，在恋爱关系中问自己问题也会很有帮助。泰勒建议向自己提出一些问题，比如：“一想到在伴侣面前表现出脆弱的样子，我会感到焦虑吗？我害怕在情感上走得太近吗？我是否倾向于将伴侣推开？我很容易吃醋吗？即使我知道我的伴侣爱我，我还需要很多安慰吗？”

Therapy has helped Phillip identify the triggers that make her want to leave relationships, so she can course-correct.

治疗帮助菲利普找出了导致她想要离开人际关系的诱因，这样她就可以纠正方向。

“The minute \[someone I’m seeing\] says something I don’t like, I’m over it,” she said. “Sometimes, it’s warranted, but I’m trying to scrutinize my motivations to end things with people. I talk to my therapist now about things I’ve noticed that make me want to stop speaking to a romantic interest, as a gut check to make sure I’m not ending things in an effort to avoid a close connection.”

“一旦（我见到的人）说出了我不喜欢的话，我就结束了，”她说。 “有时候，这是有道理的，但我正在努力审视自己与人结束关系的动机。我现在和我的治疗师谈论我注意到的那些让我想停止与恋人交谈的事情，作为一种直觉检查，以确保我不会为了避免亲密关系而结束事情。”
