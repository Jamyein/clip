**96 people had breakthroughs so far this week. Will one of them be you?**

本周到目前为止，已有 96 人取得突破。你会是其中之一吗？

## Two things for you to think about

您需要考虑的两件事

The most important things in life—trust, respect, love, happiness—must be painstakingly earned over time, but can be quickly and easily destroyed. As Warren Buffett once said, “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it.”

生活中最重要的东西——信任、尊重、爱、幸福——必须随着时间的推移艰苦地赢得，但也可能很快、很容易地被摧毁。正如沃伦·巴菲特曾经说过的那样：“建立声誉需要 20 年，毁掉它只需 5 分钟。”

One of the simplest mindset shifts you can make to find greater success is simply to extend your time horizon. Measure your major decisions not in months or years but decades. Do that consistently and you will be amazed where you end up.

为了获得更大的成功，你可以做出的最简单的心态转变之一就是延长你的时间范围。衡量你的重大决策的时间不是几个月或几年，而是几十年。坚持这样做，你会对最终的结果感到惊讶。

Reflect: Then consider sharing this thought with others.

反思：然后考虑与他人分享这个想法。

## Three things for you to ask yourself

你要问自己三件事

What if you were optimizing your life for 10 years in the future instead of this month or this year? How would your behaviors change? What new decisions would you make?

如果您优化未来 10 年的生活而不是本月或今年会怎样？你的行为会如何改变？你会做出什么新决定？

Recommended: Use these as journaling prompts for the week.

建议：使用这些作为本周的日记提示。

## One thing for you to try this week

本周您可以尝试的一件事

Take one area of your life that you’ve been optimizing for the short term and reorient your measurement of success for the long term.

选择你生活中短期内优化的一个领域，并重新调整你对长期成功的衡量标准。

For example, instead of thinking about losing a few pounds for your vacation next month, think about optimizing your health and well-being for twenty years from now. Instead of starving yourself or doing some crazy fad diet, you’d probably adopt slower-moving, but more sustainable habits that would be more likely to work in the long run.

例如，与其考虑下个月的假期减掉几磅，不如考虑从现在起二十年后优化您的健康和福祉。你可能会采取行动缓慢但更可持续的习惯，而不是让自己挨饿或进行一些疯狂的时尚节食，从长远来看，这些习惯更有可能奏效。

## Last week’s breakthroughs

上周的突破

In last week’s [newsletter](https://markmanson.net/breakthrough/023-the-law-of-avoidance), I asked you to be less rigid in your identity and experiment with being wrong about yourself for a week—a.k.a., find the benefit in _not knowing_ who the fuck you are.

在上周的时事通讯中，我要求你不要对自己的身份那么僵化，并尝试用一周的时间来尝试错误地认识自己——也就是说，找到不知道自己到底是谁的好处。

To start off, Amy is no longer labeling herself as a “bad cook”:

首先，艾米不再给自己贴上“糟糕的厨师”的标签：

> I have avoided cooking anything elaborate for years. I was in a long-term relationship for six years, and he rarely loved anything I cooked and never showed any real enthusiasm for my kitchen creations. I have since left that relationship for other reasons, and started cooking every night for myself.
>
> 多年来我一直避免烹饪任何精致的东西。我和他有六年的长期恋爱关系，他很少喜欢我做的任何东西，也从未对我的厨房创作表现出任何真正的热情。此后，我因其他原因离开了这段关系，并开始每天晚上自己做饭。
>
> I have always labeled myself as a bad cook because I couldn’t cook this one person anything he found amazing. I have since let my walls down to cook for other people and they have raved about it and it boosted my confidence immensely, and I have found such a passion for creating food. It’s amazing the stories we can start telling ourselves when we don’t have the right company around us!
>
> 我一直给自己贴上糟糕厨师的标签，因为我无法为这个人做任何他认为很棒的东西。从那以后，我放下心来为其他人做饭，他们对此赞不绝口，这极大地增强了我的信心，我发现了对创造食物的热情。当我们周围没有合适的公司时，我们可以开始给自己讲故事，这真是太神奇了！

I have certainly limited myself with a “bad cook” label based on a few unfortunate kitchen mishaps in college. I should probably be dropping mine, too.

由于大学时发生的一些不幸的厨房事故，我确实给自己贴上了“糟糕的厨师”的标签。我可能也应该放弃我的。

Another reader started a difficult journey to redefine their long-held stage identity:

另一位读者开始了一段艰难的旅程，重新定义他们长期以来的舞台身份：

> I study theater. It’s one of my biggest passions in life. However, I always told myself, since I was a teen, that I was a dramatic actress. I don’t do very well in comedy and I certainly don’t even dip my feet in the ridiculous.
>
> 我学戏剧。这是我一生中最大的热情之一。然而，从十几岁起，我就一直告诉自己，我是一名戏剧演员。我在喜剧方面表现不佳，当然我什至不会涉足荒谬的事情。
>
> In the class I am taking right now, I had to do an absurd scene. I gave it my all, even though I was very stressed about it going in. While doing it I was having the time of my life. I was thinking, ‘Hey, maybe I \*can\* do comedy.’ Everyone told me I looked in my element, that it seems to be something I was so comfortable doing.
>
> 在我现在上的课上，我必须做一个荒唐的场景。我全力以赴，尽管我对它的投入感到非常压力。在做这件事的同时，我享受着我一生中的时光。我在想，“嘿，也许我\*可以\*拍喜剧。”每个人都告诉我，我看起来很适合我，这似乎是我做起来很舒服的事情。
>
> However, as soon as I finished the scene I felt an immense sense of guilt and wanted to cry. As if a voice inside me was telling me, ‘No, you don’t do this, you shouldn’t do this. You are not a comedic actress.’
>
> 然而，当我看完这场戏后，我感到一种巨大的负罪感，想哭。好像我内心有一个声音在告诉我，‘不，你不能这样做，你不应该这样做。你不是喜剧演员。
>
> As I got home I started to talk about it with my brother, and with your newsletter I understood: I feel as if I am threatening my identity. I spent so long telling myself I cannot do comedy, that I don’t know who I am if I do. But I guess that’s alright. I don’t need to know who I am, and it can change.
>
> 当我回到家时，我开始和我的兄弟谈论这件事，通过你的时事通讯，我明白了：我觉得我好像在威胁我的身份。我花了很长时间告诉自己我不能演喜剧，如果我演了，我也不知道自己是谁。但我想那没关系。我不需要知道我是谁，而且它可以改变。

Finally, even though someone may [want to find love](https://markmanson.net/?p=63976), their identity as the “single” person could hold them back, as this reader discovered:

最后，即使有人可能想寻找爱情，他们作为“单身”者的身份也可能会阻碍他们，正如这位读者发现的那样：

> In my friend group, I’ve always been the single one. While my friends share their dating stories with me, I listen and provide ‘objective advice’ about their partners.
>
> 在我的朋友圈里，我一直都是单身。当我的朋友与我分享他们的约会故事时，我会倾听并提供有关他们伴侣的“客观建议”。
>
> Just recently I met a guy that I’m really into, and after the first few dates, I have started feeling like pulling away. I have been in my single identity for so long and my friends have always unintentionally confirmed that.
>
> 最近，我遇到了一个我真正喜欢的人，在最初的几次约会之后，我开始想抽身离开。我已经单身这么久了，我的朋友们总是无意中证实了这一点。
>
> After reading this though, I’m going to try and frame myself as less of the perpetually single person and more of the girl who is back into the dating scene.
>
> 读完这篇文章后，我将尝试把自己塑造成一个重新回到约会场景的女孩，而不是永远单身的人。
>
> Thank you for helping me be wrong about myself. Not sure what this connection will be like moving forward but I’m ready to find out!
> 谢谢你帮助我认识到自己的错误。不确定这种联系会是什么样子，但我已经准备好找出答案了！

**As always, send your breakthroughs by simply replying to this email.** Let me know if you’d prefer to remain anonymous.

与往常一样，只需回复此电子邮件即可发送您的突破。如果您愿意保持匿名，请告诉我。

Until next week, 直到下周，
