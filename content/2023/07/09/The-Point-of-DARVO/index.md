原标题：The Point of DARVO

DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender) is a common tactic deployed by abusers to co-opt one of the few (potential) sources of power available to the survivor — disclosure — and turn it towards their own project of coercive control. The abuser denies allegations of abuse (if any have yet been made, sometimes abusers preempt their victim), attacks the credibility of the survivor, and creates a narrative in which the abuser is cast as the true victim of the survivor. When some people first hear of DARVO they express concern that the reality of the tactic makes it functionally impossible to distinguish between abuser and victim, implies the presence of “mutual abuse,” or demotes the situation from abusive to simply “toxic.” With these conclusions in hand many feel as though they can safely recuse themselves from engaging with the situation entirely, thus fulfilling the abuser’s central aim in deploying DARVO as a tactic in the first place.  

DARVO（否认、攻击、反向受害者和犯罪者）是施虐者采用的一种常见策略，目的是选择幸存者可用的少数（潜在）权力来源之一——披露——并将其转向他们自己的强制控制项目。施虐者否认虐待指控（如果有的话，有时施虐者会先于受害者），攻击幸存者的可信度，并创造一个叙述，其中施虐者被描绘成幸存者的真正受害者。当一些人第一次听说 DARVO 时，他们表示担心这种策略的实际情况使其在功能上无法区分施虐者和受害者，暗示存在“相互虐待”，或者将情况从虐待降级为简单的“有毒”。有了这些结论，许多人觉得他们可以安全地完全回避参与这种情况，从而实现施虐者首先部署 DARVO 作为策略的中心目标。

The point of DARVO, contrary to popular belief, is not to convince but to seed _doubt_. The abuser does not require the surrounding community to fully and completely validate them as the true victim of the abuse, though they certainly see it as a bonus. Abuse is not an individual pathology, but an ideology of domination that must utilize or at least refer to various technologies of control that are active in the social context of abuser and victim, it is not an aberration from the status quo, but an expression of it. In the contexts in which it is enacted abuse _is_ the status quo. Therefore, as within all hegemony, the only thing that needs to happen for an empowered authoritarian to keep their power is for enough people to ignore it. The abuser does not need to convince everyone fully to their side: all they need are some close accomplices and for most everyone else to simply withhold action.  

与普遍看法相反，DARVO 的目的不是说服而是播下怀疑的种子。施虐者并不要求周围社区完全彻底地证实他们是虐待的真正受害者，尽管他们当然认为这是一种奖励。虐待不是一种个人病态，而是一种统治意识形态，必须利用或至少参考在施虐者和受害者的社会背景下活跃的各种控制技术，它不是对现状的偏离，而是一种表达它。在该法案颁布的背景下，滥用行为是现状。因此，就像在所有霸权中一样，一个被授权的独裁者要想保持其权力，唯一需要发生的事情就是让足够多的人忽视它。施虐者不需要完全说服每个人都站在他们一边：他们所需要的只是一些亲密的同谋，而大多数其他人只是不采取行动。

Because inaction from the community is often sufficient in maintaining the abusive situation (or at the very least in maintaining the empowered position of the abuser, even if an individual relationship has ended) action is the _only_ thing that can actually help the survivor. The survivor needs to be seen and understood as a survivor, as a victim the abuser’s coercive control, in order to receive adequate support. The abusive situation is characterized by the disempowerment of the victim and the disproportional empowerment of the abuser, and this power imbalance cannot be rectified if the survivor nor abuser are not accurately identified as such. When the surrounding community withholds actions of support to the survivor and challenge to the abuser because the abuser’s mobilization of DARVO makes doing so fraught and confusing, only the survivor suffers, and the conditions of the abuse maintain.  

因为社区的不作为往往足以维持虐待状况（或者至少维持施虐者的权力地位，即使个人关系已经结束），行动是唯一真正可以帮助幸存者的事情。幸存者需要被视为幸存者，被视为施虐者强制控制的受害者，以便获得足够的支持。虐待情况的特点是受害者被剥夺权力，施虐者被赋予不成比例的权力，如果没有准确识别幸存者或施虐者，这种权力失衡就无法纠正。当周围社区因为施虐者动员 DARVO 而拒绝采取行动支持幸存者并挑战施虐者时，这样做会令人担忧和困惑，只有幸存者受苦，而虐待的情况依然存在。

While DARVO may make it less simple to discern victim and abuser at a glance, it does not make it even close to impossible. Abuse is about power and a context of control, not individual actions. When people mistakenly determine abuse by one’s behavior in a singular event, or even multiple disconnected events, rather than by the entire context of the relationship, they may easily accept an abuser’s attempt at DARVO. Here is an example illustrated in The Network/La Red’s [Intimate Partner Abuse Screening Tool](https://butchanarchy.medium.com/the-point-of-darvo-ba0ace243e4e):  

虽然 DARVO 可能会让一眼辨别受害者和施虐者变得不那么容易，但这并不是说几乎不可能。虐待涉及权力和控制环境，而不是个人行为。当人们错误地根据一个人在单个事件中的行为，甚至是多个互不相关的事件中，而不是根据关系的整个背景来判断虐待行为时，他们可能很容易接受施虐者对 DARVO 的尝试。以下是 The Network/La Red 的亲密伴侣虐待筛查工具中所示的示例：

\[图片描述：图为标题为上下文、意图、效果示例的表格。桌子的一侧是幸存者对事件的反应，另一侧是施虐者的反应。

Incident: Two women who are dating are in a car. The woman in the passenger seat punches the woman who is driving.

  
事件：两名正在约会的女子在车里。副驾驶座上的女子殴打了开车的女子。

Survivor context: “My partner was driving the car and screaming at me and driving dangerously. At a red light, I punched her and ran out of the car.”

  
幸存者背景：“我的伴侣一边开车一边对我尖叫，并且危险驾驶。等红灯时，我打了她一拳，然后就跑出了车。”  

Survivor Intent: To get free of a dangerous situation, self defense.  
幸存者意图：摆脱危险境地，自卫。  

Survivor effect: Survivor gets away and flees to a friend’s house, fearing the repercussions of her action.  

幸存者效应：幸存者逃脱并逃到朋友家，担心自己的行为造成后果。

Abuser Context: “My partner was driving. We were fighting and she pulled the car over and tried to get out to leave. I punched her and told her to keep driving.”

  
施虐者背景：“我的伴侣正在开车。我们正在打架，她把车停在路边，试图下车离开。我打了她一拳，并告诉她继续开车。”  

Abuser Intent: Control partner, keep her in the car.  

施虐者意图：控制伴侣，让她留在车里。  

Abuser Effect: Abuser gains power and control through fear and violence.\]  

施虐者效应：施虐者通过恐惧和暴力获得权力和控制力。\]

Notice how if one relies on a conceptualization of abuse that focuses on individual actions like “punching is inherently abusive” to guide them, they can easily end up affirming an abuser in their control. Like on the broader political scale, the ethicality of violence is dependent on context. There are victims who use physical violence, lie, cheat, yell at/insult their abusers, break things, steal, and pretty much anything that many people seem to think disqualify someone from being a “true” victim. Often victims will do these things _because_ of the abusive context in an attempt to regain their sense of dignity and agency in a situation that places heavy restraints on their ability to exercise them. It is very easy for most abusers to pick out stories of their victims pushing back, melting down, being dysregulated, lying, etc. to damage their credibility as victims. The conditions of abuse call for a myriad of resistance strategies that, divorced from that context, can appear illegible at the least and morally condemnable at the worst. The questions to ask are not as simple as who did what in individual, decontextualized events but contextual questions such as: what is the _intent_ of that behavior (gain control over someone or take back control over oneself)? What is its effect (are they afraid or have they established control)? Who is making the decisions? Were these decisions coerced? What are the consequences for making decisions that the partner doesn’t like? Whose boundaries are respected? Who feels entitled to consistently have their way? Whose life is getting smaller?  

请注意，如果一个人依靠一种以个人行为为重点的虐待概念来指导他们，例如“打拳本质上是虐待”，那么他们很容易最终确认施虐者处于他们的控制之下。就像在更广泛的政治层面上一样，暴力的道德性取决于背景。有些受害者使用身体暴力、撒谎、欺骗、对施虐者大喊大叫/侮辱、破坏东西、偷窃，以及几乎任何许多人认为使某人失去成为“真正”受害者资格的行为。通常，受害者会因为虐待环境而做出这些事情，试图在严重限制其行使尊严和能动性的情况下重新获得尊严感和能动性。大多数施虐者很容易挑选出受害者反抗、崩溃、失调、撒谎等故事，以损害他们作为受害者的可信度。虐待的情况需要无数的抵抗策略，如果脱离了当时的背景，这些策略轻则难以辨认，重则在道德上应受谴责。要问的问题并不像谁在个人、脱离情境的事件中做了什么那么简单，而是情境问题，例如：该行为的意图是什么（获得对某人的控制或收回对自己的控制）？它的影响是什么（他们害怕还是已经建立了控制）？谁在做决定？这些决定是被迫的吗？做出合作伙伴不喜欢的决定会产生什么后果？谁的界限受到尊重？谁觉得有权始终如一地为所欲为？谁的生命越来越小？

This is why understanding abuse as a context of continuous disempowerment and control of the victim is a vital skill that can also serve to defang an abuser’s attempt at DARVO, because in practice most such attempts do not manage to stand under even the slightest scrutiny. I have seen a successful attempt at DARVO in which the survivor detailed extensive emotional, financial, and sexual abuse and the abuser responded by arguing that the survivor was the real abuser because they “didn’t allow \[the abuser\] to feel their emotions” whenever the survivor asked them to stop verbally abusing them. The abuser in this situation was believed, the survivor ostracized from their community. As discussed above, the goal isn’t to convince, but to seed doubt, and because abuse is an expression of the status quo many who have been thus far complicit (knowingly or not) are usually quite eager to grasp at any excuse to remain in comfortable complicitly rather than engage in action against social hegemony.  

这就是为什么将虐待理解为持续剥夺受害者权力和控制受害者的背景是一项至关重要的技能，也可以用来阻止施虐者对 DARVO 的企图，因为在实践中，大多数此类尝试都经不起哪怕是最轻微的审查。我在 DARVO 上看到过一次成功的尝试，其中幸存者详细描述了广泛的情感、经济和性虐待，施虐者则回应称幸存者才是真正的施虐者，因为他们“不允许\[施虐者\]感受到自己的情绪”每当幸存者要求他们停止辱骂他们时。在这种情况下，施虐者被相信，幸存者被社区排斥。正如上面所讨论的，我们的目标不是说服，而是播下怀疑的种子，而且因为虐待是现状的表现，许多迄今为止共谋的人（有意或无意）通常非常渴望抓住任何借口留下来舒适地共谋而不是从事反对社会霸权的行动。

Using the existence of DARVO as a common tactic among abusers as grounds to treat all abuse allegations with immediate skepticism ultimately fulfills the goals abusers aim towards when they deploy it. The utility of DARVO to abusers is not that it convinces everyone that they are a victim, but that it muddies the waters enough to give the surrounding community an excuse to disengage, to throw up their hands and say “we can’t know who the abuser is, so it would be better if we didn’t even try!” This position renders DARVO into such a successful tool for abusers that abuse becomes a defacto protected act as long as they utilize it. Discerning between victim and abuser in an interpersonal relationship is as possible as discerning between victim and abuser in larger oppressive systems, even when the oppressor (as they often do) cries victim. Terrains of power are analyzable even when propaganda works to obfuscate them, and from that analysis must come action. All else remains complicity with the authoritarian status quo.  

利用 DARVO 的存在作为滥用者之间的一种常见策略，以立即怀疑的态度对待所有滥用指控，最终实现了滥用者在部署 DARVO 时所要实现的目标。 DARVO 对施虐者的效用并不在于它让每个人都相信自己是受害者，而是它把水搅浑了，足以让周围的社区有借口脱离接触，举起手来说“我们不知道谁是施虐者”。施虐者就是这样，所以我们还是不去尝试比较好！”这一立场使 DARVO 成为滥用者如此成功的工具，只要他们使用它，滥用就成为事实上的受保护行为。在人际关系中区分受害者和施虐者就像在更大的压迫系统中区分受害者和施虐者一样，即使压迫者（就像他们经常做的那样）哭泣受害者。即使宣传试图混淆权力领域，权力领域也是可以分析的，而且必须从分析中得出行动。其他一切仍然是与独裁现状的共谋。
