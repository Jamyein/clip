原标题：The Abolition of Work

No one should ever work.  

任何人都不应该工作。

Work is the source of nearly all the misery in the world. Almost any evil you’d care to name comes from working or from living in a world designed for work. In order to stop suffering, we have to stop working.  

工作是世界上几乎所有痛苦的根源。几乎所有你想指出的邪恶都来自于工作或生活在一个为工作而设计的世界中。为了停止痛苦，我们必须停止工作。

That doesn’t mean we have to stop doing things. It does mean creating a new way of life based on play; in other words, a _ludic_ revolution. By “play” I mean also festivity, creativity, conviviality, commensality, and maybe even art. There is more to play than child’s play, as worthy as that is. I call for a collective adventure in generalized joy and freely interdependent exuberance. Play isn’t passive. Doubtless we all need a lot more time for sheer sloth and slack than we ever enjoy now, regardless of income or occupation, but once recovered from employment-induced exhaustion nearly all of us want to act.  

这并不意味着我们必须停止做事。它确实意味着创造一种基于游戏的新生活方式；换句话说，这是一场荒唐的革命。我所说的“游戏”还指节日、创造力、欢乐、共餐，甚至可能是艺术。除了儿戏之外，还有更多可玩的事情，尽管这很有价值。我呼吁在普遍的欢乐和自由相互依存的繁荣中进行集体冒险。玩耍不是被动的。毫无疑问，无论收入或职业如何，我们都需要比现在更多的时间来纯粹的懒惰和懈怠，但一旦从就业引起的疲惫中恢复过来，几乎所有人都想采取行动。

The ludic life is totally incompatible with existing reality. So much the worse for “reality,” the gravity hole that sucks the vitality from the little in life that still distinguishes it from mere survival. Curiously—or maybe not—all the old ideologies are conservative because they believe in work. Some of them, like Marxism and most brands of anarchism, believe in work all the more fiercely because they believe in so little else.  

荒唐的生活与现有的现实完全不相容。对于“现实”来说更糟糕的是，重力洞从生活中的微小事物中汲取活力，而这仍然将其与单纯的生存区分开来。奇怪的是——也许不是——所有旧的意识形态都是保守的，因为它们相信工作。他们中的一些人，比如马克思主义和大多数无政府主义，更加坚信工作，因为他们对其他东西几乎不相信。

Liberals say we should end employment discrimination. I say we should end employment. Conservatives support right-to-work laws. Following Karl Marx’s wayward son-in-law Paul Lafargue I support the right to be lazy. Leftists favor full employment. Like the surrealists—except that I’m not kidding—I favor full unemployment. Trotskyists agitate for permanent revolution. I agitate for permanent revelry. But if all the ideologues (as they do) advocate work—and not only because they plan to make other people do theirs—they are strangely reluctant to say so. They will carry on endlessly about wages, hours, working conditions, exploitation, productivity, profitability. They’ll gladly talk about anything but work itself. These experts who offer to do our thinking for us rarely share their conclusions about work, for all its saliency in the lives of all of us. Among themselves they quibble over the details. Unions and management agree that we ought to sell the time of our lives in exchange for survival, although they haggle over the price. Marxists think we should be bossed by bureaucrats. Libertarians think we should be bossed by businessmen. Feminists don’t care which form bossing takes so long as the bosses are women. Clearly these ideology-mongers have serious differences over how to divvy up the spoils of power. Just as clearly, none of them have any objection to power as such and all of them want to keep us working.  
自由主义者说我们应该结束就业歧视。我说我们应该结束就业。保守派支持工作权利法。跟随卡尔·马克思任性的女婿保罗·拉法格，我支持懒惰的权利。左派主张充分就业。就像超现实主义者一样——只不过我不是在开玩笑——我赞成完全失业。托洛茨基主义者鼓动不断革命。我渴望永远的狂欢。但如果所有的理论家（正如他们所做的那样）都提倡工作——而且不仅仅是因为他们计划让其他人做他们的工作——他们却奇怪地不愿意这么说。他们将无休止地谈论工资、工作时间、工作条件、剥削、生产力、盈利能力。他们很乐意谈论工作本身以外的任何事情。这些愿意为我们思考的专家很少分享他们关于工作的结论，尽管工作在我们所有人的生活中都很重要。他们内部对细节争论不休。工会和管理层一致认为，我们应该出卖生命的时间来换取生存，尽管他们在价格上讨价还价。马克思主义者认为我们应该受官僚领导。自由主义者认为我们应该由商人来领导。女权主义者不在乎采取哪种形式的领导，只要老板是女性。显然，这些意识形态贩子在如何分配权力战利品方面存在严重分歧。同样清楚的是，他们中没有人对权力本身有任何反对，并且他们都希望让我们继续工作。

You may be wondering if I’m joking or serious. I’m joking _and_ serious. To be ludic is not to be ludicrous. Play doesn’t have to be frivolous, although frivolity isn’t triviality; very often we ought to take frivolity seriously. I’d like life to be a game—but a game with high stakes. I want to play _for keeps_.  

你可能想知道我是在开玩笑还是认真的。我是开玩笑又是认真的。荒唐并不是荒唐可笑。玩耍不一定是轻浮的，尽管轻浮并不琐碎；很多时候我们应该认真对待轻浮的事情。我希望生活是一场游戏——而且是一场高风险的游戏。我想一直打球。

The alternative to work isn’t just idleness. To be ludic is not to be quaaludic. As much as I treasure the pleasure of torpor, it’s never more rewarding than when it punctuates other pleasures and pastimes. Nor am I promoting the managed time-disciplined safety-valve called “leisure;” far from it. Leisure is nonwork for the sake of work. Leisure is time spent recovering from work and in the frenzied but hopeless attempt to forget about work. Many people return from vacations so beat that they look forward to returning to work so they can rest up. The main difference between work and leisure is that at work at least you get paid for your alienation and enervation.  

工作的替代方案不仅仅是无所事事。荒唐并不意味着荒唐。尽管我非常珍惜麻木的乐趣，但它比其他乐趣和消遣更有意义。我也不是在提倡所谓“休闲”的受管理、有时间约束的安全阀；离得很远。休闲不是为了工作而工作。休闲是从工作中恢复过来的时间，以及疯狂但无望地试图忘记工作的时间。许多人度假归来后身心疲惫，期待重返工作岗位，以便得到休息。工作和休闲之间的主要区别在于，在工作中，至少你会因疏远和衰弱而得到报酬。

I am not playing definitional games with anybody. When I say I want to abolish work, I mean just what I say, but I want to say what I mean by defining my terms in non-idiosyncratic ways. My minimum definition of work is forced labor, that is, compulsory production. Both elements are essential. Work is production enforced by economic or political means, by the carrot or the stick. (The carrot is just the stick by other means.) But not all creation is work. Work is never done for its own sake, it’s done on account of some product or output that the worker (or, more often, somebody else) gets out of it. This is what work necessarily is. To define it is to despise it. But work is usually even worse than its definition decrees. The dynamic of domination intrinsic to work tends over time toward elaboration. In advanced work-riddled societies, including all industrial societies whether capitalist or “communist,” work invariably acquires other attributes which accentuate its obnoxiousness.  

我不会和任何人玩定义游戏。当我说我想废除工作时，我的意思就是我所说的，但我想通过以非特殊的方式定义我的术语来表达我的意思。我对工作的最低定义是强迫劳动，即强制生产。这两个要素都是必不可少的。工作是通过经济或政治手段、胡萝卜或大棒强制进行的生产。 （从其他方面来说，胡萝卜只是大棒。）但并非所有的创造都是工作。工作从来都不是为了工作本身而完成的，而是为了工人（或者更常见的是其他人）从中获得的某种产品或产出而完成的。这就是工作的必然。定义它就是鄙视它。但工作通常比它的定义法令还要糟糕。随着时间的推移，工作固有的支配动力趋向于精细化。在充满工作的先进社会中，包括所有工业社会，无论是资本主义还是“共产主义”，工作总是会获得其他属性，从而加剧了其令人厌恶的一面。

Usually—and this is even more true in “communist” than capitalist countries, where the state is almost the only employer and everyone is an employee—work is employment, i.e., wage-labor, which means selling yourself on the installment plan. Thus 95% of Americans who work, work for somebody (or some_thing_) else. In Cuba or China or any other alternative model which might be adduced, the corresponding figure approaches 100%. Only the embattled Third World peasant bastions—Mexico, India, Brazil, Turkey—temporarily shelter significant concentrations of agriculturists who perpetuate the traditional arrangement of most laborers in the last several millennia, the payment of taxes (= ransom) to the state or rent to parasitic landlords in return for being otherwise left alone. Even this raw deal is beginning to look good. _All_ industrial (and office) workers are employees and under the sort of surveillance which ensures servility.  

通常——在“共产主义”国家比在资本主义国家更是如此，在这些国家，国家几乎是唯一的雇主，每个人都是雇员——工作就是雇佣，即雇佣劳动，这意味着以分期付款的方式出卖自己。因此，95% 的美国人工作都是为别人（或其他东西）工作。在古巴或中国或任何其他可能引用的替代模型中，相应的数字接近100%。只有陷入困境的第三世界农民堡垒——墨西哥、印度、巴西、土耳其——暂时庇护了大量农民，他们延续了过去几千年大多数劳动力的传统安排，向国家缴纳税款（=赎金）或向政府缴纳租金。寄生地主以换取被孤立的回报。即使是这种不公平的交易也开始看起来不错。所有工业（和办公室）工人都是雇员，并受到确保奴性的监视。

But modern work has worse implications. People don’t just work, they have “jobs.” One person does one productive task all the time on an or-else basis. Even if the task has a quantum of intrinsic interest (as increasingly many jobs don’t) the monotony of its obligatory exclusivity drains its ludic potential. A “job” that might engage the energies of some people, for a reasonably limited time, for the fun of it, is just a burden on those who have to do it for forty hours a week with no say in how it should be done, for the profit of owners who contribute nothing to the project, and with no opportunity for sharing tasks or spreading the work among those who actually have to do it. This is the real world of work: a world of bureaucratic blundering, of sexual harassment and discrimination, of bonehead bosses exploiting and scapegoating their subordinates who—by any rational-technical criteria—should be calling the shots. But capitalism in the real world subordinates the rational maximization of productivity and profit to the exigencies of organizational control.  

但现代工作有更糟糕的影响。人们不只是工作，他们还有“工作”。一个人总是在“否则”的基础上完成一项富有成效的任务。即使这项任务具有一定的内在兴趣（越来越多的工作没有这种兴趣），其强制性排他性的单调性也会耗尽其有趣的潜力。一项“工作”可能会在相当有限的时间内吸引某些人的精力，只是为了其中的乐趣，但对于那些必须每周工作四十个小时却无法决定如何完成的人来说，这只是一种负担，为了那些对项目没有贡献的所有者的利益，并且没有机会在实际需要做的人之间分担任务或分散工作。这就是真实的工作世界：一个充斥着官僚主义失误、性骚扰和歧视、愚蠢老板剥削下属并为其寻找替罪羊的世界，而下属——按照任何理性的技术标准——都应该发号施令。但现实世界中的资本主义使生产力和利润的理性最大化服从于组织控制的紧迫性。

The degradation which most workers experience on the job is the sum of assorted indignities which can be denominated as “discipline.” Foucault has complexified this phenomenon but it is simple enough. Discipline consists of the totality of totalitarian controls at the workplace—surveillance, rotework, imposed work tempos, production quotas, punching-in and out, etc. Discipline is what the factory and the office and the store share with the prison and the school and the mental hospital. It is something historically original and horrible. It was beyond the capacities of such demonic dictators of yore as Nero and Genghis Khan and Ivan the Terrible. For all their bad intentions they just didn’t have the machinery to control their subjects as thoroughly as modern despots do. Discipline is the distinctively diabolical modern mode of control, it is an innovative intrusion which must be interdicted at the earliest opportunity.  

大多数工人在工作中所经历的侮辱是各种侮辱的总和，这些侮辱可以称为“纪律”。福柯把这个现象复杂化了，但其实它很简单。纪律包括工作场所的极权控制的整体——监视、死记硬背、强加的工作节奏、生产配额、上下班打卡等。纪律是工厂、办公室、商店与监狱、学校和学校所共有的。精神病院。这是历史上原创且可怕的事情。这超出了尼禄、成吉思汗和伊凡雷帝等昔日恶魔独裁者的能力范围。尽管他们的意图很坏，但他们只是没有像现代暴君那样彻底控制臣民的机制。纪律是一种极其邪恶的现代控制方式，它是一种创新的入侵，必须尽早予以制止。

Such is “work.” Play is just the opposite. Play is always voluntary. What might otherwise be play is work if it’s forced. This is axiomatic. Bernie de Koven has defined play as the “suspension of consequences.” This is unacceptable if it implies that play is inconsequential. The point is not that play is without consequences. This is to demean play. The point is that the consequences, if any, are gratuitous. Playing and giving are closely related, they are the behavioral and transactional facets of the same impulse, the play-instinct. They share an aristocratic disdain for results. The player gets something out of playing; that’s why he plays. But the core reward is the experience of the activity itself (whatever it is). Some otherwise attentive students of play, like Johan Huizinga (_Homo Ludens_), _define_ it as gameplaying or following rules. I respect Huizinga’s erudition but emphatically reject his constraints. There are many good games (chess, baseball, Monopoly, bridge) which are rule-governed but there is much more to play than game-playing. Conversation, sex, dancing, travel—these practices aren’t rule-governed but they are surely play if anything is. And rules can be _played with_ at least as readily as anything else.  

这就是“工作”。玩则恰恰相反。玩耍始终是自愿的。如果是被迫的，本来可能是玩耍的事情就是工作。这是不言自明的。伯尼·德科文将游戏定义为“暂停后果”。如果这意味着游戏无关紧要，那么这是不可接受的。重点不在于玩耍没有后果。这是贬低游戏。关键是，如果有的话，后果也是无缘无故的。玩耍和给予密切相关，它们是同一冲动（即玩耍本能）的行为和交易方面。他们对结果有着贵族式的蔑视。玩家从游戏中得到一些东西；这就是他打球的原因。但核心奖励是活动本身的体验（无论是什么）。一些专心研究游戏的学生，如 Johan Huizinga（Homo Ludens），将游戏定义为玩游戏或遵循规则。我尊重惠津加的博学，但坚决拒绝他的限制。有许多优秀的游戏（国际象棋、棒球、大富翁、桥牌）都是有规则的，但除了玩游戏之外，还有更多的东西可以玩。谈话、性、跳舞、旅行——这些行为不受规则约束，但如果有的话，它们肯定是游戏。而且规则至少可以像其他任何东西一样容易使用。

Work makes a mockery of freedom. The official line is that we all have rights and live in a democracy. Other unfortunates who aren’t free like we are have to live in police states. These victims obey orders or-else, no matter how arbitrary. The authorities keep them under regular surveillance. State bureaucrats control even the smaller details of everyday life. The officials who push them around are answerable only to higher-ups, public or private. Either way, dissent and disobedience are punished. Informers report regularly to the authorities. All this is supposed to be a very bad thing.  

工作是对自由的嘲弄。官方的说法是我们所有人都享有权利并生活在民主国家。其他像我们一样不自由的不幸者不得不生活在警察国家。这些受害者必须服从命令，否则，无论多么任意。当局对他们进行定期监视。国家官僚甚至控制着日常生活的小细节。左右他们的官员只对公共或私人的高层负责。无论哪种方式，异议和不服从都会受到惩罚。举报人定期向当局报告。这一切应该是一件非常糟糕的事情。

And so it is, although it is nothing but a description of the modern workplace. The liberals and conservatives and libertarians who lament totalitarianism are phonies and hypocrites. There is more freedom in any moderately de-Stalinized dictatorship than there is in the ordinary American workplace. You find the same sort of hierarchy and discipline in an office or factory as you do in a prison or a monastery. In fact, as Foucault and others have shown, prisons and factories came in at about the same time, and their operators consciously borrowed from each other’s control techniques. A worker is a part-time slave. The boss says when to show up, when to leave, and what to do in the meantime. He tells you how much work to do and how fast. He is free to carry his control to humiliating extremes, regulating, if he feels like it, the clothes you wear or how often you go to the bathroom. With a few exceptions he can fire you for any reason, or no reason. He has you spied on by snitches and supervisors, he amasses a dossier on every employee. Talking back is called “insubordination,” just as if a worker is a naughty child, and it not only gets you fired, it disqualifies you for unemployment compensation. Without necessarily endorsing it for them either, it is noteworthy that children at home and in school receive much the same treatment, justified in their case by their supposed immaturity. What does this say about their parents and teachers who work?  

事实也是如此，尽管它只不过是对现代工作场所的描述。哀叹极权主义的自由主义者、保守主义者和自由主义者都是骗子和伪君子。任何适度去斯大林化的独裁国家都比普通的美国工作场所拥有更多的自由。在办公室或工厂里，你会发现与在监狱或修道院里一样的等级制度和纪律。事实上，正如福柯等人所表明的那样，监狱和工厂几乎同时出现，它们的操作者有意识地借鉴了彼此的控制技术。工人是兼职的奴隶。老板规定什么时候上班，什么时候离开，以及期间要做什么。他告诉你要做多少工作以及多快。他可以自由地将自己的控制权发挥到令人羞辱的极端，如果他愿意的话，他可以控制你穿的衣服或你去洗手间的频率。除了少数例外，他可以以任何理由或无理由解雇你。他让告密者和主管监视你，他收集了每个员工的档案。顶嘴被称为“不服从”，就像一个工人是一个顽皮的孩子一样，它不仅会让你被解雇，还会使你失去领取失业救济金的资格。值得注意的是，孩子们在家里和在学校受到的待遇大致相同，这也不一定为他们所赞同，这在他们的情况下是合理的，因为他们被认为是不成熟的。这对他们工作的父母和老师意味着什么？

The demeaning system of domination I’ve described rules over half the waking hours of a majority of women and the vast majority of men for decades, for most of their lifespans. For certain purposes it’s not too misleading to call our system democracy or capitalism or—better still—industrialism, but its real names are factory fascism and office oligarchy. Anybody who says these people are “free” is lying or stupid. You are what you do. If you do boring, stupid, monotonous work, chances are you’ll end up boring, stupid, and monotonous. Work is a much better explanation for the creeping cretinization all around us than even such significant moronizing mechanisms as television and education. People who are regimented all their lives, handed to work from school and bracketed by the family in the beginning and the nursing home in the end, are habituated to hierarchy and psychologically enslaved. Their aptitude for autonomy is so atrophied that their fear of freedom is among their few rationally grounded phobias. Their obedience training at work carries over into the families they start, thus reproducing the system in more ways than one, and into politics, culture and everything else. Once you drain the vitality from people at work, they’ll likely submit to hierarchy and expertise in everything. They’re used to it.  

我所描述的有辱人格的统治体系几十年来统治着大多数女性和绝大多数男性一半以上的醒着时间，贯穿了他们一生的大部分时间。出于某些目的，将我们的制度称为民主或资本主义，或者更好的是工业主义，并不太具有误导性，但它的真实名称是工厂法西斯主义和办公室寡头政治。任何说这些人“自由”的人都是在撒谎或愚蠢。你就是你所做的。如果你做无聊、愚蠢、单调的工作，那么你很可能最终会变得无聊、愚蠢、单调。对于我们周围不断蔓延的白痴化现象，工作比电视和教育等重要的愚蠢机制能更好地解释。那些一生都受到管制的人，从学校开始工作，开始被家庭限制，最后被养老院限制，习惯了等级制度，在心理上受到奴役。他们的自主能力如此萎缩，以至于他们对自由的恐惧成为他们为数不多的有理性的恐惧症之一。他们在工作中接受的服从训练会延续到他们所建立的家庭中，从而以多种方式复制这一制度，并渗透到政治、文化和其他一切领域。一旦你耗尽了工作人员的活力，他们很可能会在所有事情上屈服于等级制度和专业知识。他们已经习惯了。

We are so close to the world of work that we can’t see what it does to us. We have to rely on outside observers from other times or other cultures to appreciate the extremity and the pathology of our present position. There was a time in our own past when the “work ethic” would have been incomprehensible, and perhaps Weber was on to something when he tied its appearance to a religion, Calvinism, which if it emerged today instead of four centuries ago would immediately and appropriately be labeled a cult. Be that as it may, we have only to draw upon the wisdom of antiquity to put work in perspective. The ancients saw work for what it is, and their view prevailed, the Calvinist cranks notwithstanding, until overthrown by industrialism—but not before receiving the endorsement of its prophets.  

我们离工作世界如此之近，以至于我们看不到它对我们有什么影响。我们必须依靠来自其他时代或其他文化的外部观察者来认识我们目前立场的极端和病态。在我们过去的某个时期，“职业道德”是难以理解的，也许韦伯把它的出现与一种宗教——加尔文主义联系在一起，他的观点是正确的，如果加尔文主义在今天而不是四个世纪前出现，它会立即和适当地被贴上邪教的标签。不管怎样，我们只需借鉴古代智慧来正确看待工作即可。古人看到了工作的本质，他们的观点占了上风，尽管有加尔文主义的怪癖，直到被工业主义推翻——但在得到工业主义先知的认可之前。

Let’s pretend for a moment that work doesn’t turn people into stultified submissives. Let’s pretend, in defiance of any plausible psychology and the ideology of its boosters, that it has no effect on the formation of character. And let’s pretend that work isn’t as boring and tiring and humiliating as we all know it really is. Even then, work would still make a mockery of all humanistic and democratic aspirations, just because it usurps so much of our time. Socrates said that manual laborers make bad friends and bad citizens because they have no time to fulfill the responsibilities of friendship and citizenship. He was right. Because of work, no matter what we do, we keep looking at our watches. The only thing “free” about so-called free time is that it doesn’t cost the boss anything. Free time is mostly devoted to getting ready for work, going to work, returning from work, and recovering from work. Free time is a euphemism for the peculiar way labor, as a factor of production, not only transports itself at its own expense to and from the workplace, but assumes primary responsibility for its own maintenance and repair. Coal and steel don’t do that. Lathes and typewriters don’t do that. No wonder Edward G. Robinson in one of his gangster movies exclaimed, “Work is for saps!”  

让我们假设工作不会使人变得愚蠢的顺从者。让我们假装，不管任何合理的心理学及其支持者的意识形态，它对性格的形成没有影响。让我们假装工作并不像我们所知道的那样无聊、劳累和丢脸。即便如此，工作仍然会嘲笑所有人文和民主的愿望，因为它侵占了我们大量的时间。苏格拉底说，体力劳动者是坏朋友和坏公民，因为他们没有时间履行友谊和公民的责任。他是对的。因为工作的原因，无论做什么，我们都会不停地看手表。所谓的空闲时间，唯一“免费”的就是老板不需要花任何钱。空闲时间主要用于为工作做准备、上班、下班回来和工作后恢复。自由时间是劳动力作为一种生产要素的特殊方式的委婉说法，它不仅自费往返于工作场所，而且承担了自身维护和修理的主要责任。煤炭和钢铁不会这样做。车床和打字机不会这样做。难怪爱德华·G·罗宾逊（Edward G. Robinson）在他的一部黑帮电影中惊呼：“工作是给笨蛋的！”

Both Plato and Xenophon attribute to Socrates and obviously share with him an awareness of the destructive effects of work on the worker as a citizen and as a human being. Herodotus identified contempt for work as an attribute of the classical Greeks at the zenith of their culture. To take only one Roman example, Cicero said that “whoever gives his labor for money sells himself and puts himself in the rank of slaves.” His candor is now rare, but contemporary primitive societies which we are wont to look down upon have provided spokesmen who have enlightened Western anthropologists. The Kapauku of West Irian, according to Posposil, have a conception of balance in life and accordingly work only every other day, the day of rest designed “to regain the lost power and health.” Our ancestors, even as late as the eighteenth century when they were far along the path to our present predicament, at least were aware of what we have forgotten, the underside of industrialization. Their religious devotion to “St. Monday”—thus establishing a _de facto_ five-day week 150-200 years before its legal consecration—was the despair of the earliest factory owners. They took a long time in submitting to the tyranny of the bell, predecessor of the time clock. In fact it was necessary for a generation or two to replace adult males with women accustomed to obedience and children who could be molded to fit industrial needs. Even the exploited peasants of the _ancien régime_ wrested substantial time back from their landlords’ work. According to Lafargue, a fourth of the French peasants’ calendar was devoted to Sundays and holidays, and Chayanov’s figures from villages in Czarist Russia—hardly a progressive society—likewise show a fourth or fifth of peasants’ days devoted to repose. Controlling for productivity, we are obviously far behind these backward societies. The exploited _muzhiks_ would wonder why any of us are working at all. So should we.  

柏拉图和色诺芬都将其归功于苏格拉底，并且显然与他一样都意识到工作对作为公民和人类的工人的破坏性影响。希罗多德认为，蔑视工作是古希腊文化鼎盛时期的一个特征。只举一个罗马人的例子，西塞罗说：“谁用自己的劳动换取金钱，谁就出卖了自己，并将自己置于奴隶的行列。”他的坦诚现在已经很少见了，但我们惯常瞧不起的当代原始社会却为西方人类学家提供了启蒙的代言人。根据波斯波斯尔的说法，西伊里安的卡帕库人有一种生活平衡的观念，因此每隔一天才工作一次，休息日旨在“恢复失去的力量和健康”。我们的祖先，即使到了十八世纪，当他们远远走向我们目前的困境时，也至少意识到了我们已经忘记的事情，即工业化的阴暗面。他们对“圣保罗”的宗教信仰。 “星期一”——从而在其法定神圣化之前 150 至 200 年建立了事实上的五天工作周——这是最早的工厂主的绝望之举。他们花了很长时间才屈服于钟的暴政，钟是打卡钟的前身。事实上，有必要用一两代人的时间来用习惯于服从的女性和可以被塑造以适应工业需求的儿童来取代成年男性。即使是旧制度下受剥削的农民也从地主的工作中夺回了大量的时间。根据拉法格的说法，法国农民日历的四分之一用于周日和假日，查亚诺夫的沙皇俄罗斯村庄的数据（几乎不是一个进步的社会）同样显示农民的四分之一或五分之一的时间用于休息。 如果控制生产力的话，我们显然远远落后于这些落后社会。被剥削的农民会想知道我们为什么要工作。我们也应该如此。

To grasp the full enormity of our deterioration, however, consider the earliest condition of humanity, without government or property, when we wandered as hunter-gatherers. Hobbes surmised that life was then nasty, brutish and short. Others assume that life was a desperate unremitting struggle for subsistence, a war waged against a harsh Nature with death and disaster awaiting the unlucky or anyone who was unequal to the challenge of the struggle for existence. Actually, that was all a projection of fears for the collapse of government authority over communities unaccustomed to doing without it, like the England of Hobbes during the Civil War. Hobbes’ compatriots had already encountered alternative forms of society which illustrated other ways of life—in North America, particularly—but already these were too remote from their experience to be understandable. (The lower orders, closer to the condition of the Indians, understood it better and often found it attractive. Throughout the seventeenth century, English settlers defected to Indian tribes or, captured in war, refused to return to the colonies. But the Indians no more defected to white settlements than West Germans climbed the Berlin Wall from the west.) The “survival of the fittest” version—the Thomas Huxley version—of Darwinism was a better account of economic conditions in Victorian England than it was of natural selection, as the anarchist Kropotkin showed in his book _Mutual Aid, A Factor in Evolution_. (Kropotkin was a scientist—a geographer—who’d had ample involuntary opportunity for fieldwork whilst exiled in Siberia: he knew what he was talking about.) Like most social and political theory, the story Hobbes and his successors told was really unacknowledged autobiography.  

然而，要全面了解我们退化的严重性，请考虑一下人类最早的状况，当时我们作为狩猎采集者流浪，没有政府或财产。霍布斯推测当时的生活是肮脏、野蛮和短暂的。另一些人则认为，生命是一场为生存而进行的绝望而不懈的斗争，是一场与严酷自然进行的战争，死亡和灾难等待着那些不幸的人或任何无力应对生存斗争挑战的人。事实上，这都是对政府权威崩溃的恐惧的投射，这些社区不习惯没有政府权威，就像内战期间霍布斯的英国一样。霍布斯的同胞们已经遇到了另一种社会形式，这些形式展示了其他生活方式——尤其是在北美——但这些已经与他们的经验相距太远，无法理解。 （更接近印第安人处境的下层阶级更了解这一点，并且经常发现它很有吸引力。在整个 17 世纪，英国定居者叛逃到印第安部落，或者在战争中被俘，拒绝返回殖民地。但印第安人没有比起自然选择，达尔文主义的“适者生存”版本（托马斯·赫胥黎版本）更好地解释了维多利亚时代英国的经济状况，正如无政府主义者克鲁泡特金在他的著作《互助，进化的一个因素》中所表明的那样。 （克鲁泡特金是一位科学家——地理学家——在流放西伯利亚期间，他有充足的非自愿机会进行实地考察：他知道自己在说什么。）像大多数社会和政治理论一样，霍布斯和他的继任者讲述的故事实际上是未被承认的自传。

The anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, surveying the data on contemporary hunter-gatherers, exploded the Hobbesian myth in an article entitled “The Original Affluent Society.” They work a lot less than we do, and their work is hard to distinguish from what we regard as play. Sahlins concluded that “hunters and gatherers work less than we do; and, rather than a continuous travail, the food quest is intermittent, leisure abundant, and there is a greater amount of sleep in the daytime per capita per year than in any other condition of society.” They worked an average of four hours a day, assuming they were “working” at all. Their “labor,” as it appears to us, was skilled labor which exercised their physical and intellectual capacities; unskilled labor on any large scale, as Sahlins says, is impossible except under industrialism. Thus it satisfied Friedrich Schiller’s definition of play, the only occasion on which man realizes his complete humanity by giving full “play” to both sides of his twofold nature, thinking and feeling. As he put it: “The animal _works_ when deprivation is the mainspring of its activity, and it _plays_ when the fullness of its strength is this mainspring, when superabundant life is its own stimulus to activity.” (A modern version—dubiously developmental—is Abraham Maslow’s counterposition of “deficiency” and “growth” motivation.) Play and freedom are, as regards production, coextensive. Even Marx, who belongs (for all his good intentions) in the productivist pantheon, observed that “the realm of freedom does not commence until the point is passed where labor under the compulsion of necessity and external utility is required.” He never could quite bring himself to identify this happy circumstance as what it is, the abolition of work—it’s rather anomalous, after all, to be pro-worker and anti-work—but we can.  

人类学家马歇尔·萨林斯在调查了当代狩猎采集者的数据后，在题为《原始富裕社会》的文章中推翻了霍布斯神话。他们的工作量比我们少得多，而且他们的工作与我们眼中的娱乐很难区分。萨林斯总结道：“狩猎者和采集者的工作量比我们少；他们的工作量比我们少。”而且，对食物的追求不是持续的辛苦，而是间歇性的，闲暇时间丰富，每年人均白天的睡眠时间比社会任何其他条件下都多。”假设他们真的在“工作”，他们平均每天工作四个小时。在我们看来，他们的“劳动”是锻炼他们体力和智力的熟练劳动。正如萨林斯所说，除非在工业主义下，否则任何大规模的非熟练劳动力都是不可能的。因此，它满足了弗里德里希·席勒对游戏的定义，这是人类通过充分“发挥”其双重本性、思维和情感的两面来实现其完整人性的唯一场合。正如他所说：“当剥夺是动物活动的主要动力时，动物就会工作；当其力量的充实是其活动的主要动力时，当过剩的生命是其活动的刺激因素时，动物就会玩耍。” （现代版本——可疑的发展——是亚伯拉罕·马斯洛对“缺乏”和“增长”动机的对立。）就生产而言，游戏和自由是同延的。即使马克思（尽管他的意图是好的）也属于生产主义万神殿，他也观察到，“直到需要在必要性和外部效用的强制下进行劳动的那一刻，自由的领域才开始。他永远无法让自己认清这种幸福的情况到底是什么，废除工作——毕竟，支持工人、反对工作是相当反常的——但我们可以。

The aspiration to go backwards or forwards to a life without work is evident in every serious social or cultural history of pre-industrial Europe, among them M. Dorothy George’s _England in Transition_ and Peter Burke’s _Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe_. Also pertinent is Daniel Bell’s essay “Work and Its Discontents,” the first text, I believe, to refer to the “revolt against work” in so many words and, had it been understood, an important correction to the complacency ordinarily associated with the volume in which it was collected, _The End of Ideology_. Neither critics nor celebrants have noticed that Bell’s end-of-ideology thesis signaled not the end of social unrest but the beginning of a new, uncharted phase unconstrained and uninformed by ideology. It was Seymour Lipset (in _Political Man_), not Bell, who announced at the same time that “the fundamental problems of the Industrial Revolution have been solved,” only a few years before the post- or meta-industrial discontents of college students drove Lipset from UC Berkeley to the relative (and temporary) tranquillity of Harvard.  

倒退或前进到没有工作的生活的愿望在前工业化欧洲的每一部严肃的社会或文化历史中都很明显，其中包括多萝西·乔治（M. Dorothy George）的《转型中的英国》和彼得·伯克（Peter Burke）的《早期现代欧洲的流行文化》。同样相关的是丹尼尔·贝尔的文章《工作及其不满》，我相信，这是第一篇用如此多的文字提到“对工作的反抗”的文章，如果理解它的话，这是对通常与工作相关的自满情绪的一个重要纠正。它被收录在其中的一卷《意识形态的终结》中。批评者和庆祝者都没有注意到，贝尔的意识形态终结论并不标志着社会动荡的结束，而是一个不受意识形态约束和未知的新阶段的开始。正是西摩·利普塞特（Seymour Lipset，《政治人》），而不是贝尔，同时宣布“工业革命的根本问题已经解决”，就在几年前，后工业或元工业的不满情绪引发了大学生的不满。利普塞特从加州大学伯克利分校来到相对（且暂时）宁静的哈佛。

As Bell notes, Adam Smith in _The Wealth of Nations_, for all his enthusiasm for the market and the division of labor, was more alert to (and more honest about) the seamy side of work than Ayn Rand or the Chicago economists or any of Smith’s modern epigones. As Smith observed: “The understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose life is spent in performing a few simple operations… has no occasion to exert his understanding… He generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.” Here, in a few blunt words, is my critique of work. Bell, writing in 1956, the Golden Age of Eisenhower imbecility and American self-satisfaction, identified the unorganized, unorganizable malaise of the 1970s and since, the one no political tendency is able to harness, the one identified in HEW’s report _Work in America_, the one which cannot be exploited and so is ignored. That problem is the revolt against work. It does not figure in any text by any laissez-faire economist—Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard, Richard Posner—because, in their terms, as they used to say on _Lost in Space_, “it does not compute.”  

正如贝尔指出的那样，《国富论》中的亚当·斯密尽管对市场和劳动分工充满热情，但他比安·兰德、芝加哥经济学家或任何其他经济学家对工作中阴暗的一面更加警觉（也更加诚实）。史密斯的现代追随者。正如史密斯所观察到的：“大多数人的理解必然是由他们的日常工作形成的。一个人的一生都花在执行一些简单的操作上……没有机会发挥他的理解力……他通常会变得像人类一样愚蠢和无知。”这里，用几句话直言不讳地表达我对工作的批评。贝尔在 1956 年撰写的《艾森豪威尔愚蠢和美国人自我满足的黄金时代》中指出了 20 世纪 70 年代无组织、无组织的弊病，此后任何政治倾向都无法驾驭这种弊病，HEW 的报告《美国的工作》中指出了这一点，无法利用的，因此被忽略。这个问题就是对工作的反抗。米尔顿·弗里德曼、穆雷·罗斯巴德、理查德·波斯纳等自由主义经济学家的任何著作中都没有出现它，因为用他们的话说，正如他们在《迷失太空》中常说的那样，“它不会计算”。

If these objections, informed by the love of liberty, fail to persuade humanists of a utilitarian or even paternalist turn, there are others which they cannot disregard. Work is hazardous to your health, to borrow a book title. In fact, work is mass murder or genocide. Directly or indirectly, work will kill most of the people who read these words. Between 14,000 and 25,000 workers are killed annually in this country on the job. Over two million are disabled. Twenty to twenty-five million are injured every year. And these figures are based on a very conservative estimation of what constitutes a work-related injury. Thus they don’t count the half-million cases of occupational disease every year. I looked at one medical textbook on occupational diseases which was 1,200 pages long. Even this barely scratches the surface. The available statistics count the obvious cases like the 100,000 miners who have black lung disease, of whom 4,000 die every year. What the statistics don’t show is that tens of millions of people have their lifespans shortened by work—which is all that homicide means, after all. Consider the doctors who work themselves to death in their late 50’s. Consider all the other workaholics.  

如果这些出于对自由的热爱而提出的反对意见未能说服人文主义者转向功利主义甚至家长主义，那么他们也不能忽视其他一些反对意见。借用书名，工作有害健康。事实上，工作就是大规模谋杀或种族灭绝。工作会直接或间接地杀死大多数读到这些话的人。该国每年有 14,000 至 25,000 名工人在工作中丧生。超过200万残疾人。每年有 20 至 2500 万人受伤。这些数字是基于对工伤构成的非常保守的估计。因此他们没有统计每年有50万职业病病例。我看了一本1200页的职业病医学教科书。即便如此，这也仅仅触及表面。据现有统计数据，有10万矿工患有黑肺病，每年有4000人死亡。统计数据没有显示的是，数千万人的寿命因工作而缩短——毕竟，这就是凶杀的全部意义。想想那些在 50 多岁的时候工作到死的医生。考虑一下所有其他工作狂。

Even if you aren’t killed or crippled while actually working, you very well might be while going to work, coming from work, looking for work, or trying to forget about work. The vast majority of victims of the automobile are either doing one of these work-obligatory activities or else fall afoul of those who do them. To this augmented body-count must be added the victims of auto-industrial pollution and work-induced alcoholism and drug addiction. Both cancer and heart disease are modern afflictions normally traceable, directly or indirectly, to work.  

即使您在实际工作时没有被杀或致残，您也很可能在上班、下班、找工作或试图忘记工作时被杀或致残。绝大多数汽车受害者要么正在从事这些强制性工作活动，要么与从事这些活动的人发生冲突。除了这一增加的死亡人数之外，还必须加上汽车工业污染以及工作引起的酗酒和吸毒成瘾的受害者。癌症和心脏病都是现代疾病，通常可以直接或间接地追溯到工作。

Work, then, institutionalizes homicide as a way of life. People think the Cambodians were crazy for exterminating themselves, but are we any different? The Pol Pot regime at least had a vision, however blurred, of an egalitarian society. We kill people in the six-figure range (at least) in order to sell Big Macs and Cadillacs to the survivors. Our forty or fifty thousand annual highway fatalities are victims, not martyrs. They died for nothing—or rather, they died for work. But work is nothing to die for.  

那么，工作将杀人制度化为一种生活方式。人们认为柬埔寨人疯狂地自我灭绝，但我们有什么不同吗？波尔布特政权至少有一个平等社会的愿景，无论多么模糊。我们（至少）杀死了六位数的人，以便向幸存者出售巨无霸和凯迪拉克。我们每年有四万或五万高速公路死亡者是受害者，而不是烈士。他们毫无意义地死去——或者更确切地说，他们是为了工作而死。但工作并不值得为之而死。

State control of the economy is no solution. Work is, if anything, more dangerous in the state-socialist countries than it is here. Thousands of Russian workers were killed or injured building the Moscow subway. Chernobyl and other Soviet nuclear disasters covered up until recently make Times Beach and Three Mile Island—but not Bhopal—look like elementary-school air-raid drills. On the other hand, deregulation, currently fashionable, won’t help and will probably hurt. From a health and safety standpoint, among others, work was at its worst in the days when the economy most closely approximated laissez-faire. Historians like Eugene Genovese have argued persuasively that—as antebellum slavery apologists insisted—factory wage-workers in the Northern American states and in Europe were worse off than Southern plantation slaves. No rearrangement of relations among bureaucrats and businessmen seems to make much difference at the point of production. Serious implementation of even the rather vague standards enforceable in theory by OSHA would probably bring the economy to a standstill. The enforcers apparently appreciate this, since they don’t even try to crack down on most malefactors.  

国家控制经济并不是解决问题的办法。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是在社会主义国家工作比在美国更危险。莫斯科地铁建设导致数千名俄罗斯工人伤亡。直到最近才被掩盖的切尔诺贝利和其他苏联核灾难使得时代海滩和三哩岛（而不是博帕尔）看起来像小学的空袭演习。另一方面，目前流行的放松管制不仅无济于事，而且可能会造成伤害。从健康和安全等角度来看，在经济最接近自由放任的时期，工作状况最为糟糕。尤金·吉诺维斯等历史学家令人信服地指出，正如南北战争前奴隶制辩护者所坚持的那样，北美各州和欧洲的工厂工资工人的境况比南方种植园奴隶还要糟糕。官僚和商人之间关系的重新安排似乎对生产没有多大影响。即使是 OSHA 理论上可以执行的相当模糊的标准，认真执行也可能会使经济陷入停滞。执法者显然很欣赏这一点，因为他们甚至没有试图打击大多数犯罪分子。

What I’ve said so far ought not to be controversial. Many workers are fed up with work. There are high and rising rates of absenteeism, turnover, employee theft and sabotage, wildcat strikes, and overall goldbricking on the job. There may be some movement toward a conscious and not just visceral rejection of work. And yet the prevalent feeling, universal among bosses and their agents and also widespread among workers themselves, is that work itself is inevitable and necessary.  

到目前为止我所说的应该不会引起争议。许多工人厌倦了工作。缺勤、人员流动、员工盗窃和破坏、自发罢工以及工作中的整体金砖混杂现象都很高，而且还在不断上升。可能会出现一些有意识地而非本能地拒绝工作的趋势。然而，老板及其代理人以及工人本身普遍存在的普遍感觉是，工作本身是不可避免的和必要的。

I disagree. It is now possible to abolish work and replace it, insofar as it serves useful purposes, with a multitude of new kinds of free activities. To abolish work requires going at it from two directions, quantitative and qualitative. On the one hand, on the quantitative side, we have to cut down massively on the amount of work being done. At present most work is useless or worse and we should simply get rid of it. On the other hand—and I think this the crux of the matter and the revolutionary new departure—we have to take what useful work remains and transform it into a pleasing variety of game-like and craft-like pastimes, indistinguishable from other pleasurable pastimes except that they happen to yield useful end-products. Surely that shouldn’t make them _less_ enticing to do. Then all the artificial barriers of power and property could come down. Creation could become recreation. And we could all stop being afraid of each other.  

我不同意。现在可以废除工作，并用多种新的自由活动来取代它，只要它能达到有用的目的。废除工作需要从定量和定性两个方向着手。一方面，在数量方面，我们必须大量减少正在完成的工作量。目前大多数工作都是无用的或者更糟糕，我们应该干脆摆脱它。另一方面——我认为这是问题的关键和革命性的新出发点——我们必须把剩下的有用的工作转化为各种令人愉悦的游戏和手工消遣，与其他令人愉快的消遣没有区别只是它们碰巧产生了有用的最终产品。当然，这不会降低他们这样做的吸引力。然后，所有权力和财产的人为障碍都会被拆除。创造可以成为娱乐。我们都可以不再害怕彼此。

I don’t suggest that most work is salvageable in this way. But then most work isn’t worth trying to save. Only a small and diminishing fraction of work serves any useful purpose independent of the defense and reproduction of the work-system and its political and legal appendages. Thirty years ago, Paul and Percival Goodman estimated that just five percent of the work then being done—presumably the figure, if accurate, is lower now—would satisfy our minimal needs for food, clothing and shelter. Theirs was only an educated guess but the main point is quite clear: directly or indirectly, most work serves the unproductive purposes of commerce or social control. Right off the bat we can liberate tens of millions of salesmen, soldiers, managers, cops, stockbrokers, clergymen, bankers, lawyers, teachers, landlords, security guards, ad-men and everyone who works for them. There is a snowball effect since every time you idle some bigshot you liberate his flunkies and underlings also. Thus the economy _implodes_.  

我并不认为大多数工作都可以通过这种方式挽救。但大多数工作都不值得尝试保存。只有一小部分且不断减少的工作能够独立于工作体系及其政治和法律附属物的防御和再生产而发挥任何有用的作用。三十年前，保罗和珀西瓦尔·古德曼估计，当时所做的工作只有百分之五（如果准确的话，现在的数字可能更低）可以满足我们对食物、衣服和住所的最低需求。他们的猜测只是有根据的猜测，但要点非常明确：大多数工作直接或间接地服务于商业或社会控制的非生产性目的。我们可以立即解放数以千万计的推销员、士兵、经理、警察、股票经纪人、牧师、银行家、律师、教师、房东、保安、广告人员以及为他们工作的每个人。这会产生滚雪球效应，因为每次你闲置某个大人物时，你也会解放他的走狗和下属。因此经济崩溃了。

Forty percent of the workforce are white-collar workers, most of whom have some of the most tedious and idiotic jobs ever concocted. Entire industries, insurance and banking and real estate for instance, consist of nothing but useless paper-shuffling. It is no accident that the “tertiary sector,” the service sector, is growing while the “secondary sector” (industry) stagnates and the “primary sector” (agriculture) nearly disappears. Because work is unnecessary except to those whose power it secures, workers are shifted from relatively useful to relatively useless occupations as a measure to ensure public order. Anything is better than nothing. That’s why you can’t go home just because you finish early. They want your _time_, enough of it to make you theirs, even if they have no use for most of it. Otherwise why hasn’t the average work week gone down by more than a few minutes in the last sixty years?  

百分之四十的劳动力是白领工人，其中大多数人从事着一些有史以来最乏味和最愚蠢的工作。整个行业，例如保险业、银行业和房地产业，都只是无用的纸上谈兵。 “第三产业”（即服务业）不断增长，而“第二产业”（工业）停滞不前，“第一产业”（农业）几乎消失，这绝非偶然。由于除了那些获得权力的人之外，工作是不必要的，因此，作为确保公共秩序的一项措施，工人从相对有用的职业转向相对无用的职业。任何事情都比什么都没有好。这就是为什么你不能因为提前完成而回家。他们想要你的时间，足够的时间让你成为他们的，即使他们大部分时间都没有用。否则为什么在过去六十年里平均每周工作时间没有减少超过几分钟呢？

Next we can take a meat-cleaver to production work itself. No more war production, nuclear power, junk food, feminine hygiene deodorant—and above all, no more auto industry to speak of. An occasional Stanley Steamer or Model T might be all right, but the auto-eroticism on which such pest-holes as Detroit and Los Angeles depend is out of the question. Already, without even trying, we’ve virtually solved the energy crisis, the environmental crisis and assorted other insoluble social problems.  

接下来我们可以使用切肉刀进行生产工作。不再有战争生产、核能、垃圾食品、女性卫生除臭剂——最重要的是，不再有汽车工业可言。偶尔来一辆斯坦利蒸汽船或T型车也许还可以，但底特律和洛杉矶等虫洞所依赖的自慰就不可能了。我们已经不费吹灰之力就实质上解决了能源危机、环境危机以及其他各种无法解决的社会问题。

Finally, we must do away with far and away the largest occupation, the one with the longest hours, the lowest pay and some of the most tedious tasks around. I refer to _housewives_ doing housework and child-rearing. By abolishing wage-labor and achieving full unemployment we undermine the sexual division of labor. The nuclear family as we know it is an inevitable adaptation to the division of labor imposed by modern wage-work. Like it or not, as things have been for the last century or two it is economically rational for the man to bring home the bacon, for the woman to do the shitwork and provide him with a haven in a heartless world, and for the children to be marched off to youth concentration camps called “schools,” primarily to keep them out of Mom’s hair but still under control, but incidentally to acquire the habits of obedience and punctuality so necessary for workers. If you would be rid of patriarchy, get rid of the nuclear family whose unpaid “shadow work,” as Ivan Illich says, makes possible the work-system that makes it necessary. Bound up with this no-nukes strategy is the abolition of childhood and the closing of the schools. There are more full-time students than full-time workers in this country. We need children as teachers, not students. They have a lot to contribute to the ludic revolution because they’re better at playing than grown-ups are. Adults and children are not identical but they will become equal through interdependence. Only play can bridge the generation gap.  

最后，我们必须彻底废除规模最大、工作时间最长、工资最低以及一些最繁琐任务的职业。我指的是做家务和抚养孩子的家庭主妇。通过废除雇佣劳动和实现充分失业，我们破坏了劳动的性别分工。我们所知道的核心家庭是对现代工资工作所强加的劳动分工的不可避免的适应。不管你喜欢与否，就像过去一两个世纪的情况一样，对于男人来说，养家糊口，女人去做狗屎活，为他在这个无情的世界里提供一个避风港，对于孩子们来说，在经济上都是合理的。被押往被称为“学校”的青少年集中营，主要是为了让他们远离妈妈的头发，但仍处于控制之下，但顺便也为了养成工人所必需的服从和守时的习惯。如果你想摆脱父权制，就摆脱核心家庭，正如伊万·伊里奇所说，他们的无偿“影子工作”使工作制度成为可能，而这种工作制度是必要的。与这一无核武器战略紧密相关的是废除童年和关闭学校。这个国家的全日制学生比全职工人还多。我们需要孩子作为老师，而不是学生。他们可以为游戏革命做出很多贡献，因为他们比成年人更擅长玩耍。成人和儿童并不相同，但通过相互依存，他们将变得平等。只有玩耍才能弥合代沟。

I haven’t as yet even mentioned the possibility of cutting way down on the little work that remains by automating and cybernizing it. All the scientists and engineers and technicians freed from bothering with war research and planned obsolescence should have a good time devising means to eliminate fatigue and tedium and danger from activities like mining. Undoubtedly they’ll find other projects to amuse themselves with. Perhaps they’ll set up world-wide all-inclusive multi-media communications systems or found space colonies. Perhaps. I myself am no gadget freak. I wouldn’t care to live in a pushbutton paradise. I don’t want robot slaves to do everything; I want to do things myself. There is, I think, a place for labor-saving technology, but a modest place. The historical and pre-historical record is not encouraging. When productive technology went from hunting-gathering to agriculture and on to industry, work increased while skills and self-determination diminished. The further evolution of industrialism has accentuated what Harry Braverman called the degradation of work. Intelligent observers have always been aware of this. John Stuart Mill wrote that all the labor-saving inventions ever devised haven’t saved a moment’s labor. Karl Marx wrote that “it would be possible to write a history of the inventions, made since 1830, for the sole purpose of supplying capital with weapons against the revolts of the working class.” The enthusiastic technophiles—Saint-Simon, Comte, Lenin, B.F. Skinner—have always been unabashed authoritarians also; which is to say, technocrats. We should be more than skeptical about the promises of the computer mystics. _They_ work like dogs; chances are, if they have their way, so will the rest of us. But if they have any particularized contributions more readily subordinated to human purposes than the run of high tech, let’s give them a hearing.  

我什至还没有提到通过自动化和网络化来减少剩余工作的可能性。所有从战争研究和计划报废中解脱出来的科学家、工程师和技术人员都应该享受设计消除采矿等活动带来的疲劳、乏味和危险的方法的美好时光。毫无疑问，他们会找到其他项目来娱乐自己。也许他们会建立全球包罗万象的多媒体通信系统或建立太空殖民地。也许。我本人并不是一个小玩意儿狂。我不想生活在一个按钮天堂里。我不希望机器人奴隶做所有的事情；我想自己做事。我认为，节省劳动力的技术有一席之地，但规模不大。历史和史前记录并不令人鼓舞。当生产技术从狩猎采集转向农业再转向工业时，工作增加了，而技能和自决权却减少了。工业主义的进一步发展加剧了哈利·布雷弗曼所说的工作退化。聪明的观察者一直都意识到这一点。约翰·斯图尔特·密尔 (John Stuart Mill) 写道，有史以来所有节省劳力的发明都没有节省一刻的劳力。卡尔·马克思写道：“可以写一部自 1830 年以来的发明的历史，其唯一目的是为资本提供武器来对抗工人阶级的反抗。”热情的技术爱好者——圣西蒙、孔德、列宁、B.F.斯金纳——也一直是毫不掩饰的独裁者。也就是说，技术官僚。我们应该对计算机神秘主义者的承诺持怀疑态度。他们像狗一样工作；很可能，如果他们得逞，我们其他人也会如此。 但如果他们有任何比高科技的运行更容易服从于人类目的的具体贡献，让我们听听他们的意见。

What I really want to see is work turned into play. A first step is to discard the notions of a “job” and an “occupation.” Even activities that already have some ludic content lose most of it by being reduced to jobs which certain people, and only those people, are forced to do to the exclusion of all else. Is it not odd that farm workers toil painfully in the fields while their air-conditioned masters go home every weekend and putter about in their gardens? Under a system of permanent revelry, we will witness the Golden Age of the dilettante which will put the Renaissance to shame. There won’t be any more jobs, just things to do and people to do them.  

我真正希望看到的是工作变成娱乐。第一步是放弃“工作”和“职业”的概念。即使是已经有一些荒唐内容的活动，也会因为沦为某些人（而且只有这些人）被迫从事的工作而失去大部分内容，而排除其他所有人。农场工人在地里辛苦劳作，而他们的主人却每周末都回家在花园里闲逛，这难道不奇怪吗？在永久狂欢的制度下，我们将见证业余爱好者的黄金时代，这将使文艺复兴蒙羞。不会再有工作了，只有要做的事和去做这些事的人。

The secret of turning work into play, as Charles Fourier demonstrated, is to arrange useful activities to take advantage of whatever it is that various people at various times in fact enjoy doing. To make it possible for some people to do the things they could enjoy, it will be enough just to eradicate the irrationalities and distortions which afflict these activities when they are reduced to work. I, for instance, would enjoy doing some (not too much) teaching, but I don’t want coerced students and I don’t care to suck up to pathetic pedants for tenure.  
正如查尔斯·傅里叶所证明的，将工作变成娱乐的秘诀是安排有用的活动，以利用不同的人在不同时间实际上喜欢做的任何事情。为了让一些人能够做他们喜欢的事情，只要消除当他们被迫工作时困扰这些活动的非理性和扭曲就足够了。例如，我很乐意做一些（不是太多）教学，但我不想要强迫学生，也不想为了终身教职而巴结可悲的学究。

Second, there are some things that people like to do from time to time, but not for too long, and certainly not all the time. You might enjoy baby-sitting for a few hours in order to share the company of kids, but not as much as their parents do. The parents meanwhile profoundly appreciate the time to themselves that you free up for them, although they’d get fretful if parted from their progeny for too long. These differences among individuals are what make a life of free play possible. The same principle applies to many other areas of activity, especially the primal ones. Thus many people enjoy cooking when they can practice it seriously at their leisure, but not when they’re just fueling up human bodies for work.  

其次，有些事情人们喜欢时不时地做，但不会持续太久，当然也不会一直做。您可能会喜欢照顾几个小时，以便分享孩子的陪伴，但不像他们的父母那样喜欢。与此同时，父母们也非常感谢你为他们腾出独处的时间，尽管如果与后代分开太久，他们会感到烦躁。个体之间的这些差异使得自由玩耍的生活成为可能。同样的原则也适用于许多其他活动领域，尤其是原始领域。因此，许多人在闲暇时认真练习烹饪时会喜欢烹饪，但当他们只是为了工作为人体补充能量时就不喜欢烹饪了。

Third—other things being equal—some things that are unsatisfying if done by yourself or in unpleasant surroundings or at the orders of an overlord are enjoyable, at least for a while, if these circumstances are changed. This is probably true, to some extent, of all work. People deploy their otherwise wasted ingenuity to make a game of the least inviting drudge-jobs as best they can. Activities that appeal to some people don’t always appeal to all others, but everyone at least potentially has a variety of interests and an interest in variety. As the saying goes, “anything once.” Fourier was the master at speculating about how aberrant and perverse penchants could be put to use in post-civilized society, what he called Harmony. He thought the Emperor Nero would have turned out all right if as a child he could have indulged his taste for bloodshed by working in a slaughterhouse. Small children who notoriously relish wallowing in filth could be organized in “Little Hordes” to clean toilets and empty the garbage, with medals awarded to the outstanding. I am not arguing for these precise examples but for the underlying principle, which I think makes perfect sense as one dimension of an overall revolutionary transformation. Bear in mind that we don’t have to take today’s work just as we find it and match it up with the proper people, some of whom would have to be perverse indeed.  

第三，在其他条件相同的情况下，有些事情如果是你自己做的、在不愉快的环境中做的、或者在领主的命令下做的，是令人不满意的，但如果这些情况改变了，至少在一段时间内是令人愉快的。在某种程度上，这可能适用于所有工作。人们利用他们原本浪费的聪明才智，尽可能地制作一款最不吸引人的苦差事的游戏。吸引某些人的活动并不总是吸引所有其他人，但每个人至少都可能有各种各样的兴趣和对多样性的兴趣。俗话说“凡事一次就好”。傅里叶是推测如何在后文明社会中利用异常和反常倾向的大师，他称之为“和谐”。他认为，如果尼禄皇帝小时候能够在屠宰场工作，放纵自己嗜血的嗜好，结果会很好。众所周知，喜欢在肮脏的地方打滚的小孩子可以被组织成“小部落”，清洁厕所和倒垃圾，并为表现出色的人颁发奖牌。我并不是在论证这些精确的例子，而是在论证基本原则，我认为它作为全面革命性变革的一个维度是非常有意义的。请记住，我们不必按照我们发现的那样接受今天的工作，并将其与合适的人相匹配，其中一些人确实是不正当的。

If technology has a role in all this, it is less to automate work out of existence than to open up new realms for re/creation. To some extent we may want to return to handicrafts, which William Morris considered a probable and desirable upshot of communist revolution. Art would be taken back from the snobs and collectors, abolished as a specialized department catering to an elite audience, and its qualities of beauty and creation restored to integral life from which they were stolen by work. It’s a sobering thought that the Grecian urns we write odes about and showcase in museums were used in their own time to store olive oil. I doubt our everyday artifacts will fare as well in the future, if there is one. The point is that there’s no such thing as progress in the world of work; if anything, it’s just the opposite. We shouldn’t hesitate to pilfer the past for what it has to offer, the ancients lose nothing yet we are enriched.  

如果技术在这一切中发挥作用，那么与其说是让工作自动化，不如说是为再创造开辟新的领域。在某种程度上，我们可能想回归手工艺，威廉·莫里斯认为手工艺是共产主义革命可能和理想的结果。艺术将从势利小人和收藏家手中夺回，废除作为迎合精英观众的专门部门，其美感和创造的品质将恢复到被工作偷走的完整生活中。我们写颂歌并在博物馆中展示的希腊瓮在他们自己的时代被用来储存橄榄油，这是一个发人深省的想法。我怀疑我们的日常手工艺品在未来是否也会有同样的表现（如果有的话）。关键是，工作世界里不存在进步这回事。如果有什么不同的话，那就是恰恰相反。我们应该毫不犹豫地窃取过去的东西，古人没有失去任何东西，而我们却变得丰富起来。

The reinvention of daily life means marching off the edge of our maps. There is, it is true, more suggestive speculation than most people suspect. Besides Fourier and Morris—and even a hint, here and there, in Marx—there are the writings of Kropotkin, the syndicalists Pataud and Pouget, anarcho-communists old (Berkman) and new (Bookchin). The Goodman brothers’ _Communitas_ is exemplary for illustrating what forms follow from given functions (purposes), and there is something to be gleaned form the often hazy heralds of alternative/appropriate/intermediate/convivial technology, like Schumacher and especially Illich, once you disconnect their fog machines. The situationists—as represented by Vaneigem’s _Revolution of Everyday Life_ and in the _Situationist International Anthology_—are so ruthlessly lucid as to be exhilarating, even if they never did quite square the endorsement of the rule of the workers’ councils with the abolition of work. Better their incongruity, though, than any extant version of leftism, whose devotees look to be the last champions of work, for if there were no work there would be no workers, and without workers, whom would the left have to organize?  

重塑日常生活意味着走出我们地图的边缘。确实，存在比大多数人怀疑的更具暗示性的猜测。除了傅里叶和莫里斯——甚至在马克思的著作中，到处都有暗示——还有克鲁泡特金、工团主义者帕托和普热、老无政府共产主义者（伯克曼）和新无政府共产主义者（布克钦）的著作。古德曼兄弟的 Communitas 是说明给定功能（目的）所遵循的形式的典范，一旦你断开连接，就可以从替代/适当/中间/欢乐技术的经常模糊的先驱中收集一些东西，例如舒马赫，尤其是伊利奇他们的造雾机。情境主义者——以瓦内海姆的《日常生活革命》和《情境主义国际选集》为代表——是如此残酷地清醒，令人振奋，即使他们从未将工人委员会规则的支持与废除工作完全调和起来。不过，他们的不协调性比任何现存的左派都要好，左派的信徒看起来是工作的最后捍卫者，因为如果没有工作，就不会有工人，而没有工人，左派又得组织谁呢？

So the abolitionists will be largely on their own. No one can say what would result from unleashing the creative power stultified by work. Anything can happen. The tiresome debater’s problem of freedom vs. necessity, with its theological overtones, resolves itself practically once the production of use-values is coextensive with the consumption of delightful play-activity.  

因此，废奴主义者将在很大程度上依靠他们自己。没有人能说清楚释放因工作而停滞的创造力会产生什么结果。任何事情都可能发生。一旦使用价值的生产与令人愉快的游戏活动的消费同时存在，令人厌烦的辩论者关于自由与必然的问题及其神学色彩实际上就得到了解决。

Life will become a game, or rather many games, but not—as it is now—a zero/sum game. An optimal sexual encounter is the paradigm of productive play. The participants potentiate each other’s pleasures, nobody keeps score, and everybody wins. The more you give, the more you get. In the ludic life, the best of sex will diffuse into the better part of daily life. Generalized play leads to the libidinization of life. Sex, in turn, can become less urgent and desperate, more playful. If we play our cards right, we can all get more out of life than we put into it; but only if we play for keeps.  

生活将成为一场游戏，或者更确切地说是许多游戏，但不会像现在这样成为零/和游戏。最佳的性接触是富有成效的游戏的范例。参与者增强彼此的快乐，没有人记分，每个人都是赢家。你给予的越多，你得到的就越多。在嬉戏的生活中，最好的性爱会扩散到日常生活中更好的部分。普遍的游戏导致生活的性欲化。反过来，性可以变得不那么紧迫和绝望，而是更有趣。如果我们打得好，我们就能从生活中得到比我们投入更多的东西；但前提是我们要坚持下去。

Workers of the world… _relax!_  

全世界的工人……放松吧！
