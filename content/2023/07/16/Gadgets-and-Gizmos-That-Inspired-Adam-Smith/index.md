Pocket gadgets were all the rage in Adam Smith's day. Their popularity inspired one of the most paradoxical, charming, and insightful passages in his work.  
在亚当·斯密的时代，袖珍小玩意非常流行。它们的受欢迎激发了他作品中最矛盾、迷人和富有洞察力的段落之一。

The best known are watches. A pocket timepiece was an 18th century man's must-have fashion accessory, its presence indicated by a ribbon or bright steel chain hanging from the owner's waist, bedecked with seals and a watch key. Contemporary art depicts not just affluent people but sailors and farm workers sporting watch chains. One sailor even wears two. "It had been the pride of my life, ever since pride commenced, to wear a watch," wrote a journeyman stocking maker about acquiring his first in 1747.  
其中最著名的是手表。怀表是 18 世纪男士必备的时尚配饰，其存在通过佩戴者腰间垂下的丝带或明亮的钢链来体现，上面饰有密封件和手表钥匙。当代艺术不仅描绘了富裕的人们，还描绘了戴着表链的水手和农场工人。一名水手甚至穿着两件。一位熟练的袜子制造商在谈到 1747 年购买的第一块手表时写道：“自从我开始自豪以来，戴手表一直是我一生的骄傲。”

Laborers could buy watches secondhand and pawn them when they needed cash. A favorite target for pickpockets, "watches were consistently the most valuable item of apparel stolen from working men in the eighteenth century," writes historian John Styles, who analyzed records from several English jurisdictions.  
劳动者可以购买二手手表，并在需要现金时将其典当。历史学家约翰·斯泰尔斯分析了几个英国司法管辖区的记录，他写道，“手表一直是十八世纪工人偷窃的最有价值的服装”，是扒手最喜欢的目标。

But timepieces were hardly the only gizmos stuffing 18th century pockets, especially among the well-to-do. At a coffeehouse, a gentleman might pull out a silver nutmeg grater to add spice to his drink or a pocket globe to make a geographical point. The scientifically inclined might carry a simple microscope, known as a flea glass, to examine flowers and insects while strolling through gardens or fields. He could gaze through a pocket telescope and then, with a few twists, convert it into a mini-microscope. He could improve his observations with a pocket tripod or camera obscura and could pencil notes in a pocket diary or on an erasable sheet of ivory. (Not content with a single sheet, Thomas Jefferson carried ivory pocket notebooks.)  
但钟表并不是 18 世纪人们口袋里唯一的小玩意，尤其是在富裕阶层中。在咖啡馆里，一位绅士可能会拿出一个银色肉豆蔻磨碎器来为他的饮料添加香料，或者拿出一个袖珍地球仪来标记一个地理点。热爱科学的人可能会携带一个简单的显微镜（称为跳蚤镜），在花园或田野中漫步时检查花朵和昆虫。他可以通过袖珍望远镜进行观察，然后经过一些调整，将其变成微型显微镜。他可以用袖珍三脚架或暗箱改善观察效果，还可以用铅笔在袖珍日记本或可擦的象牙纸上做笔记。 （托马斯·杰斐逊并不满足于一张纸，他还带着象牙色的袖珍笔记本。）

The coolest of all pocket gadgets were what antiquarians call *etuis* and Smith referred to as "tweezer cases." A typical 18th century etui looks like a slightly oversized cigarette lighter covered in shagreen, a textured rawhide made from shark or ray skin. The lid opens up to reveal an assortment of miniature tools, each fitting into an appropriately shaped slot. Today's crossword puzzle clues often describe etuis as sewing or needle cases, but that was only one of many varieties. An etui might contain drawing instruments—a compass, ruler, pencil, and set of pen nibs. It could hold surgeon's tools or tiny perfume bottles. Many offered a tool set handy for travelers: a tiny knife, two-pronged fork, and snuff spoon; scissors, tweezers, a razor, and an earwax scraper; a pencil holder and pen nib; perhaps a ruler or bodkin. The cap of a cylindrical etui might separate into a spyglass.  
所有袖珍小玩意中最酷的是古文物学家所说的 etuis 和史密斯所说的“镊子盒”。典型的 18 世纪 etui 看起来像一个稍大的打火机，上面覆盖着鲨鱼皮，这是一种由鲨鱼或鳐鱼皮制成的有纹理的生皮。打开盖子，可以看到各种微型工具，每个工具都安装在形状适当的槽中。今天的填字游戏线索经常将 etuis 描述为缝纫或针盒，但这只是众多品种之一。 etui 可能包含绘图工具——圆规、尺子、铅笔和一套笔尖。它可以容纳外科医生的工具或小香水瓶。许多人为旅行者提供了一套方便的工具：一把小刀、两头叉子和鼻烟壶；剪刀、镊子、剃须刀和耳垢刮刀；笔架和笔尖；也许是一把尺子或木头。圆柱形埃图伊的盖子可能会分离成望远镜。

All these "toys," as they were called, kept early manufacturers busy, especially in the British metal-working capital of Birmingham. A 1767 directory listed some 100 Birmingham toy makers, producing everything from buttons and buckles to tweezers and toothpick cases. "For Cheapness, Beauty and Elegance no Place in the world can vie with them," the directory declared. Like Smith's famous pin factory, these preindustrial plants depended on hand tools and the division of labor, not automated machinery.  
所有这些所谓的“玩具”让早期的制造商忙碌起来，尤其是在英国金属加工之都伯明翰。一份 1767 年的名录列出了大约 100 家伯明翰玩具制造商，生产从纽扣、带扣到镊子和牙签盒等各种产品。名录宣称：“就廉价、美丽和优雅而言，世界上没有任何地方可以与它们相媲美。”就像史密斯著名的别针工厂一样，这些前工业化工厂依赖于手动工具和劳动分工，而不是自动化机械。

Ingenious and ostensibly useful, pocket gadgets and other toys epitomized a new culture of consumption that also included tea, tobacco, gin, and printed cotton fabrics. These items were neither the traditional indulgences of the rich nor the necessities of life. Few people needed a pocket watch, let alone a flea glass or an etui. But these gadgets were fashionable, and they tempted buyers from a wide range of incomes.  
袖珍小玩意和其他玩具精巧且表面上很有用，它们体现了一种新的消费文化，其中还包括茶叶、烟草、杜松子酒和印花棉织物。这些物品既不是富人的传统嗜好，也不是生活必需品。很少有人需要怀表，更不用说跳蚤杯或 etui 了。但这些小玩意很时尚，吸引了各种收入的买家。

A fool "cannot withstand the charms of a toyshop; snuff-boxes, watches, heads of canes, etc., are his destruction," the Earl of Chesterfield warned his son in a 1749 letter. He returned to the subject the following year. "There is another sort of expense that I will not allow, only because it is a silly one," he wrote. "I mean the fooling away your money in baubles at toy shops. Have one handsome snuff-box (if you take snuff), and one handsome sword; but then no more pretty and very useless things." A fortune, Chesterfield cautioned, could quickly disappear through impulse purchases.  
切斯特菲尔德伯爵在 1749 年的一封信中警告他的儿子，傻瓜“无法承受玩具店的魅力；鼻烟盒、手表、手杖头等等，都是他的毁灭”。第二年他又回到了这个话题。 “还有另一种费用我不会允许，只是因为这是愚蠢的，”他写道。 “我的意思是在玩具店里用小玩意骗钱。有一个漂亮的鼻烟盒（如果你带鼻烟），和一把漂亮的剑；但然后就不再有漂亮和无用的东西了。”切斯特菲尔德警告说，一笔财富可能会因冲动购买而迅速消失。

In *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, first published in 1759, Smith examined what made these objects so enticing. Pocket gadgets claimed to have practical functions, but these "trinkets of frivolous utility" struck Smith as more trouble than they were worth. He deemed their appeal less practical than aesthetic and imaginative.  
在 1759 年首次出版的《道德情操论》中，史密斯研究了是什么让这些物品如此诱人。袖珍小玩意声称具有实用功能，但史密斯认为这些“无意义的实用小玩意”带来的麻烦大于其价值。他认为它们的吸引力与其说是实用，不如说是审美和想象力。

"What pleases these lovers of toys is not so much the utility," Smith wrote, "as the aptness of the machines which are fitted to promote it. All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences. They contrive new pockets, unknown in the clothes of other people, in order to carry a greater number." Toys embodied *aptness*, "the beauty of order, of art and contrivance." They were ingenious and precise. They were cool. And they weren't the only objects of desire with these qualities.  
“让这些玩具爱好者高兴的并不是实用性，”史密斯写道，“而是为了推广玩具而安装的机器的适应性。他们所有的口袋里都塞满了一些小便利设施。他们设计了新的口袋，这些口袋在衣服中是未知的。”的其他人，以便携带更多的数量。”玩具体现了适应性，“秩序之美、艺术之美和设计之美”。他们巧妙而精确。他们很酷。而且他们并不是唯一具有这些品质的渴望对象。

The same pattern applied, Smith argued, to the idea of wealth. He portrayed the ambitious son of a poor man, who imagines that servants, coaches, and a large mansion would make his life run smoothly. Pursuing a glamorous vision of wealth and convenience, he experiences anxiety, hardship, and fatigue. Finally, in old age, "he begins at last to find that wealth and greatness are mere trinkets of frivolous utility, no more adapted for procuring ease of body or tranquillity of mind than the tweezer-cases of the lover of toys."  
史密斯认为，同样的模式也适用于财富的概念。他描绘了一个穷人的雄心勃勃的儿子，他想象仆人、教练和一座大宅邸会让他的生活过得顺利。为了追求财富和便利的美好愿景，他经历了焦虑、艰辛和疲劳。最后，到了晚年，“他终于开始发现，财富和伟大只不过是无意义实用的小玩意儿，并不比玩具爱好者的镊子盒更适合获得身体的舒适或心灵的平静。”

Yet Smith didn't condemn the aspiring poor man or deride the lover of toys. He depicted them with sympathetic bemusement, recognizing their foibles as both common and paradoxically productive. We evaluate such desires as irrational only when we're sick or depressed, he suggested. In a good mood, we care less about the practical costs and benefits than about the joys provided by "the order, the regular and harmonious movement of the system….The pleasures of wealth and greatness, when considered in this complex view, strike the imagination as something grand and beautiful and noble, of which the attainment is well worth all the toil and anxiety."  
然而史密斯并没有谴责有抱负的穷人，也没有嘲笑玩具爱好者。他以同情的困惑来描绘他们，认识到他们的缺点既常见又矛盾。他表示，只有当我们生病或沮丧时，我们才会认为这些欲望是非理性的。心情好的时候，我们不太关心实际的成本和收益，而是关心“系统的秩序、有规律、和谐的运动所带来的乐趣……当从这种复杂的角度考虑时，财富和伟大的乐趣，会震撼我们的心灵”。想象力是伟大、美丽和高贵的东西，为了获得它，所有的辛劳和焦虑都是值得的。”

Besides, Smith suggested, pursuing the false promise of tranquility and convenience had social benefits. It was nothing less than the source of civilization itself: "It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found cities and commonwealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embellish human life; which have entirely changed the whole face of the globe, have turned the rude forests of nature into agreeable and fertile plains, and made the trackless and barren ocean a new fund of subsistence, and the great high road of communication to the different nations of the earth."  
此外，史密斯认为，追求宁静和便利的虚假承诺也有社会效益。它正是文明本身的源泉：“正是这一点首先促使他们耕种土地，建造房屋，建立城市和联邦，并发明和改进所有科学和艺术，这些科学和艺术使人类变得高贵和美化。生命；它彻底改变了地球的整个面貌，把原始的大自然森林变成了宜人而肥沃的平原，把无路可走和贫瘠的海洋变成了新的生存来源，变成了通往不同国家的伟大公路。地球的。”

Then Smith gave his analysis a twist. The same aesthetic impulse that draws people to ingenious trinkets and leads them to pursue wealth and greatness, he argued, also inspires projects for public improvements, from roads and canals to constitutional reforms. However worthwhile one's preferred policies might be for public welfare, their benefits—like those of a pocket globe—are secondary to the beauty of the system.  
然后史密斯改变了他的分析。他认为，同样的审美冲动吸引人们购买精巧的小饰品，引导他们追求财富和伟大，也激发了从道路和运河到宪法改革等公共改善项目。无论一个人偏爱的政策对于公共福利来说多么有价值，它们的好处——就像袖珍地球仪的好处——与系统的美丽相比是次要的。

"The perfection of police, the extension of trade and manufactures, are noble and magnificent objects," he wrote. "The contemplation of them pleases us, and we are interested in whatever can tend to advance them. They make part of the great system of government, and the wheels of the political machine seem to move with more harmony and ease by means of them. We take pleasure in beholding the perfection of so beautiful and grand a system, and we are uneasy till we remove any obstruction that can in the least disturb or encumber the regularity of its motions." Only the least self-aware policy wonk can fail to see the truth in Smith's claim.  
“警察的完善、贸易和制造业的扩展，都是崇高而宏伟的目标，”他写道。 “对它们的思考使我们高兴，我们对任何能够推动它们发展的事物都感兴趣。它们是伟大政府体系的一部分，政治机器的车轮似乎通过它们更加和谐和轻松地运转。我们很高兴看到如此美丽而宏伟的系统的完美，并且我们会感到不安，直到我们移除任何可能至少扰乱或阻碍其运动规律的障碍。”只有最没有自知之明的政策专家才会看不到史密斯的主张的真相。

Here, however, the separation of means and end can be more serious than in the case of a trinket of frivolous utility. Buying a gadget you don't need because you like the way it works doesn't hurt anyone but you. Enacting policies because they sound cool can hurt the public they're supposed to benefit. "All constitutions of government," Smith reminded readers, "are valued only in proportion as they tend to promote the happiness of those who live under them. This is their sole use and end." Elsewhere in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, Smith criticized the "man of system" who imposed his ideal order, heedless of the wishes of those he governed.  
然而，在这里，手段和目的的分离可能比无意义的实用小饰品的情况更为严重。因为你喜欢它的工作方式而购买你不需要的小工具不会伤害除了你之外的任何人。因为听起来很酷而制定政策可能会伤害他们本应受益的公众。史密斯提醒读者，“所有政府宪法的价值都取决于它们能否促进生活在宪法之下的人们的幸福。这是它们的唯一用途和目的。”在《道德情操论》的其他地方，斯密批评了那些不顾他所统治者的意愿而强加理想秩序的“制度人”。

Smith appreciated the beauty and allure of systems. His life's work was to formulate systematic understandings of social orders, and he concluded his discussion on an optimistic note. Depicting an appealingly intricate system, he suggested, could enlist those otherwise uninterested in beneficial reforms. Seduce them with organization charts!  
史密斯欣赏系统的美丽和魅力。他一生的工作就是对社会秩序形成系统的理解，他以乐观的基调结束了他的讨论。他建议，描绘一个有吸引力的复杂体系可以吸引那些对有益改革不感兴趣的人。用组织结构图引诱他们！

"You will be more likely to persuade," Smith wrote, "if you describe the great system of public police which procures these advantages, if you explain the connexions and dependencies of its several parts, their mutual subordination to one another, and their general subserviency to the happiness of the society; if you show how this system might be introduced into his own country, what it is that hinders it from taking place there at present, how those obstructions might be removed, and all the several wheels of the machine of government be made to move with more harmony and smoothness, without grating upon one another, or mutually retarding one another's motions."  
史密斯写道：“如果你描述了获得这些优势的伟大的公共警察系统，如果你解释了它的各个部分的联系和依赖性、它们之间的相互隶属关系以及它们的一般性，那么你就更有可能说服别人。对社会幸福的服从；如果你展示了如何将这种制度引入他自己的国家，目前是什么阻碍了它在那里发生，如何消除这些障碍，以及机器的所有几个轮子政府各部门的行动应更加和谐、顺利，不会互相干扰，也不会互相阻碍。”

It's hard not to see this argument as the inspiration for *Wealth of Nations*. If Smith could make an economy of free exchange seem as cool as the latest intricate gadget, he might just be able to sell it.  
很难不把这一论点视为《国富论》的灵感来源。如果史密斯能让自由交换经济看起来像最新的复杂小玩意一样酷，他也许就能把它卖掉。
