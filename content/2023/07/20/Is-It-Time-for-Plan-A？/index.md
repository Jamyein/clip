In all my years of school I never studied. Chapters from the textbook were assigned regularly, but I didn’t feel like I could read them. I didn’t know how to stay interested enough to absorb any knowledge from them.

在我上学的这些年里，我从未学习过。课本上的章节是定期布置的，但我觉得我读不懂。我不知道如何保持足够的兴趣来吸收他们的知识。

Studying, for me, amounted to looking up bolded words in the glossary and trying to remember what the teacher had been talking about when she said, “This will be on the test.”

对我来说，学习就是在词汇表中查找粗体单词，并试图记住老师说“这将在考试中出现”时所说的内容。

I was well aware that studying is a normal thing people do, an obvious and straightforward solution to school’s challenges, just as washing the dishes in soapy water is an obvious solution to having an unsightly pile of dishes in the sink. Whenever I sought instruction on how to study, however, it was assumed that one could simply read a textbook when necessary, and I could not explain why I couldn’t do that.

我很清楚学习是人们做的一件正常的事情，是解决学校挑战的一个明显而直接的解决方案，就像用肥皂水洗碗是解决水槽里一堆难看的盘子的一个明显的解决方案一样。然而，每当我寻求如何学习的指导时，人们都认为必要时可以简单地阅读教科书，而我无法解释为什么我不能这样做。

Somehow I got by, although my no-studying method was definitely inferior to the usual “some studying” method. My marks were good through primary school, “satisfactory” in high school, and probationary in college. I did graduate, but I was anxious and afraid all the time, and lived my life avoiding any endeavors involving the reading of dense material, whether at school, work, or play.

总算熬过来了，虽然我的不学习方法肯定比不上通常的“有学习”方法。我的小学成绩一直很好，高中成绩“令人满意”，大学预科成绩也很好。我确实毕业了，但我一直感到焦虑和恐惧，并且在生活中避免任何涉及阅读厚重材料的努力，无论是在学校、工作还是玩耍。

### The Long Way Around

漫漫长路

I suspect my studying problem is one form of a common scenario: there’s a normal and straightforward way to do a thing, yet you’ve come to do it in some eccentric roundabout way that doesn’t work so well, just because you can’t get on board with the usual way for some reason.

我怀疑我的学习问题是一个常见场景的一种形式：做一件事有一种正常而直接的方式，但你却用某种古怪的迂回方式来做，效果不太好，只是因为你出于某种原因无法采用通常的方式。

Maybe you get too nervous trying to parallel park on the street, despite ample spots, so you always pay for an underground lot and have to walk a half-mile each way. Or you don’t go to the cinema anymore solely because you’re embarrassed to shuffle past people mid-movie go to the bathroom, and you may have to do that. Or you always must maintain a large supply of change because you don’t know how those MetroPass things work, eight years after they introduced them.

尽管停车位充足，但尝试在街道上平行停车时，您可能会感到太紧张，因此您总是付费购买地下停车位，并且单程必须步行半英里。或者你不再去电影院只是因为你不好意思在电影中途与别人擦肩而过去洗手间，而你可能不得不这样做。或者你总是必须保持大量零钱，因为你不知道这些 MetroPass 东西是如何工作的，在它们推出八年后。

*For some, a root canal

对于某些人来说，需要进行根管治疗*

I’m sure all of us make private compromises around certain specific corners of life, tasks that others seem to navigate as a matter of course by doing the simple and obvious thing. Just quit avoiding it and learn to park. Just get up and go to the bathroom. Just crack the books and study.

我确信我们所有人都会在生活中的某些特定角落做出私下妥协，而其他人似乎通过做简单而明显的事情来完成这些任务。只要停止躲避它并学会停车即可。起身去洗手间。只要翻开书本并学习即可。

We may have our reasons, at least at first: acute anxiety around certain situations, a genuine inability to understand a common concept or perform a common action, or just a sense that you’re not ready to tackle this particular question mark quite yet. Whatever it is, you balk and go around where others just go ahead.

我们可能有自己的理由，至少一开始是这样：对某些情况感到严重焦虑，真正无法理解一个共同的概念或执行一个共同的行动，或者只是感觉你还没有准备好解决这个特定的问号。不管是什么，你都会犹豫不决，绕着别人走的地方走。

*Me, going around 我，四处走动*

Maybe you can relate to the above examples, or something like them. Or perhaps you know someone who does a certain thing in a seemingly self-defeating and inefficient way:

也许你可以参考上面的例子，或者类似的例子。或者，也许你认识一个人，他以一种看似自欺欺人、低效的方式做某件事：

-   A man insists he cannot cook and cannot learn to cook. “I burn everything,” he says. Privately, he has always found it stressful to try follow a recipe, mostly because he turns on the burner before he even starts [prepping the ingredients](https://www.raptitude.com/2021/10/how-to-level-up-instead-of-plugging-away/). So he lives on takeout, to the detriment of his health and finances.
    
    一个人坚持认为他不会做饭，也无法学会做饭。 “我烧掉了一切，”他说。私下里，他总是觉得尝试遵循菜谱很有压力，主要是因为他甚至在开始准备原料之前就打开了燃烧器。因此，他靠外卖为生，这损害了他的健康和财务状况。

-   Another man has worn a simple buzzcut his entire adult life because he has never known how to do his hair in a way he likes. He’d love to have something more interesting, but the possibility of making it look good feels beyond him.
    
    另一个男人成年后一直留着简单的平头发型，因为他从来不知道如何按照自己喜欢的方式打理头发。他希望能有一些更有趣的东西，但让它看起来更好的可能性超出了他的想象。

-   A woman doesn’t invest her savings because money stuff has always felt too complicated, so she keeps it all in a low-interest savings account. She rarely thinks about investing now. Her unusual retirement strategy has already cost her tens of thousands of dollars.
   
	女人不会用自己的积蓄进行投资，因为金钱的东西总是让人感觉太复杂，所以她把所有的钱都存入低息储蓄账户。她现在很少考虑投资了。她不寻常的退休策略已经让她损失了数万美元。

-   A man can never remember what the washing symbols on clothing tags mean, so he washes everything together on the default setting, every time. His clothes get clean enough, although he has to replace them often, and he doesn’t wear white garments anymore because they just won’t stay white.
    
    男人永远记不住衣服标签上的洗涤符号的含义，所以他每次都会按照默认设置将所有东西一起洗涤。他的衣服变得足够干净，尽管他必须经常更换它们，而且他不再穿白色衣服，因为它们不会保持白色。

-   A woman has a little garden, where she only grows chives and thyme, because she thinks they’re the only plants she can keep alive. She’d love to grow some big colorful flowers but it feels like it would be tricky — annuals, perennials, climate zones, and all that.
    
    一个女人有一个小花园，她只在那里种植韭菜和百里香，因为她认为它们是她唯一可以存活的植物。她很想种一些色彩缤纷的大花，但感觉这会很棘手——一年生植物、多年生植物、气候带植物等等。

-   An office worker doesn’t go out with her colleagues because she’s afraid people will make fun of her for not drinking alcohol. Instead of going anyway and ordering whatever she wants, she simply declines every invitation. She likes these people, and is respected in the office, but she always feels like an outsider because everybody else knows each other.
   
	一名上班族不和同事出去，因为她担心别人会嘲笑她不喝酒。她没有无论如何都去订购她想要的任何东西，而是简单地拒绝了每一个邀请。她喜欢这些人，在办公室里受到尊重，但她总是感觉自己像个局外人，因为其他人都互相认识。

A casual observer in all of these cases would be scratching their head. Why don’t you just read Investing for Dummies? Why not take half an hour and learn the laundry symbols? Why not just go out with the coworkers and see what it’s like?

对于所有这些情况，一个不经意的观察者都会摸不着头脑。你为什么不直接阅读《傻瓜投资》呢？为什么不花半个小时学习一下洗衣符号呢？为什么不和同事一起出去看看是什么样的呢？

What has happened with each of these people is that they’ve abandoned the usual, most straightforward way at some point — which is virtually everyone’s Plan A — because it seemed unworkable or painful when they tried it, or thought about trying it. To get by, they’ve settled on an idiosyncratic Plan B, which “works” but is more costly, less rewarding, and makes the person feel left out of something others seem to do freely.

这些人身上发生的事情是，他们在某个时候放弃了通常、最直接的方法——这实际上是每个人的 A 计划——因为当他们尝试或考虑尝试时，它似乎不可行或痛苦。为了度过难关，他们选择了一种特殊的B计划，该计划“有效”，但成本更高，回报更少，并且让人感觉自己被排除在其他人似乎可以自由做的事情之外。

*Perhaps not impenetrable 或许并非坚不可摧*

Over time, Plan B methods get so familiar that they become part of your identity. You become blind to the possibility that the thing can be a lot simpler. Plan A is how things work for others, and Plan B is simply how your life must be.

随着时间的推移，B 计划方法变得越来越熟悉，以至于它们成为您身份的一部分。你对事情可以变得简单得多的可能性视而不见。 A 计划是为他人做事的方式，而 B 计划则是你的生活必须如何。

In fact, Plan Bs become so ingrained that you might not even realize you’re making a fairly drastic compromise. The only clue might be that everybody else does a certain thing in a common, conventional way, with little visible trouble, and you do that thing some other way, and it remains troublesome to you.

事实上，B 计划变得如此根深蒂固，以至于你可能甚至没有意识到你正在做出相当彻底的妥协。唯一的线索可能是，其他人都以一种常见的、传统的方式做某件事，几乎没有明显的麻烦，而你用其他方式做那件事，这对你来说仍然很麻烦。

For example, I always shy away from swimming-related activities because in my mind it seems like such a hassle — finding a place to change, putting my wallet and phone somewhere safe, doing something with my sopping trunks afterward — even though I like swimming itself, and those reservations are all small, easily solved problems that everyone else just deals with.

例如，我总是回避与游泳相关的活动，因为在我看来，这似乎很麻烦——找个地方换衣服，把钱包和手机放在安全的地方，然后用湿透的泳裤做点什么——尽管我喜欢游泳本身，而这些保留都是小而容易解决的问题，其他人只是处理。

### Stepping off the long detour

走出漫长的弯路

Being stuck in a Plan B can feel like a personal curse, but really, it’s just a method. Cooking and growing flowers works under the same laws for everyone. If the fish gets to the right temperature for the right amount of time, it cooks nicely. If the flower gets the light and nutrients it needs, it grows. There is no person for whom those conditions have some other result, but there are people who have stopped trying to create those conditions and are doing something else.

陷入 B 计划可能感觉像是一种个人诅咒，但实际上，这只是一种方法。烹饪和养花对每个人来说都遵循相同的法律。如果鱼在适当的温度下保持适当的时间，它就会煮得很好。如果花得到所需的阳光和养分，它就会生长。没有人会因这些条件而产生其他结果，但有些人已经停止尝试创造这些条件并正在做其他事情。

*The preferred trajectory 首选轨迹*

And they probably stopped with Plan A after only a few early failures. It doesn’t take many painful or frustrating experiences before you’re looking elsewhere for a way past. And you’ll always find some way, some Plan B. But the problem with Plan A might have been a small or contingent thing that’s no trouble anymore, or at least isn’t the brick wall it once seemed to be. Maybe you just didn’t have someone to ask for help, or there was no internet back then, or you were just younger and less wise.

在经历了几次早期的失败之后，他们可能就停止了 A 计划。不需要经历很多痛苦或沮丧的经历，你就会去别处寻找过去的出路。你总会找到某种方法，一些 B 计划。但是 A 计划的问题可能是一件小事或偶然的事情，不再有麻烦了，或者至少不再像以前那样是一堵砖墙。也许你只是没有人可以寻求帮助，或者当时没有互联网，或者你只是更年轻，不那么聪明。

It occurred to me recently — after trying to explain to someone why I can’t simply *study* the topics I want to be well-studied in — just how many Plan A’s I’ve abandoned in my life, and how many might work fine now. [Undiagnosed ADHD](https://www.raptitude.com/2021/03/what-raptitude-has-always-been-about/) has instilled a *lot* of Plan B compromises in me, so many that I began to assume that *no* Plan A approach is going work for me, even before I’ve tried it.

最近，在试图向某人解释为什么我不能简单地研究我想深入研究的主题后，我突然想到，我一生中放弃了多少 A 计划，以及有多少现在可能会发挥作用。未确诊的多动症给我灌输了很多 B 计划的妥协，以至于我开始认为 A 计划的方法对我不起作用，甚至在我尝试之前也是如此。

*Due for retirement 到期退休*

Anyway, I’m now going back to Plan A approaches I’d long abandoned — and they work! Ten or twenty years later, I find I have sufficient patience to sort out the details of most normal, straightforward methods without getting frustrated. Lo and behold, I can understand and use financial instruments. I can make pastry. I can study.

不管怎样，我现在要回到我早已放弃的 A 计划方法——而且它们有效！十年或二十年后，我发现我有足够的耐心来理清最正常、直接的方法的细节，而不会感到沮丧。你瞧，我可以理解并使用金融工具。我可以做糕点。我可以学习。

You’re probably not as hard a case as I am though. Whatever your challenge is, perhaps it’s finally time for Plan A.

不过，你可能不像我那么难缠。无论您面临什么挑战，也许终于到了 A 计划的时候了。
