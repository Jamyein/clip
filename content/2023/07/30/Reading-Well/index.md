Reading is alluring. It has a nameless quality beyond satisfying desires for information and pleasure. Despite more colorful and interactive media, reading text somehow remains more refined, more seductive.

读书是有诱惑力的。它具有一种无法名状的品质，超越了满足对信息和快乐的渴望。尽管媒体更加丰富多彩和互动，但阅读文本在某种程度上仍然更加精致、更加诱人。

There is a visceral feeling to good reading. Partly this is because reading is nearly solitary.

At the beginning you are alone with just the characters. By the end, you are alone with just the author. To hear him well demands no other distractions. When one reads, or at least when I read, it is always very slowly and in a voice. Perhaps you have already imagined a voice you are reading this in. Say hello for me.

良好的阅读有一种发自内心的感觉。部分原因是阅读几乎是孤独的。 1 一开始，你独自一人与角色在一起。到最后，你就只剩下作者一个人了。想要听清楚他的声音，不需要任何其他干扰。当人们阅读时，或者至少当我阅读时，总是非常缓慢且有声音。也许你已经想象出了你正在读这篇文章的声音。代我问好。

Reading is letting someone else model the world for you. This is an act of intimacy. When the author is morose, you become morose. When he is mirthful, eventually you may share in it. And after finishing a very good book one is driven a little mad, forced to return from a world that no one nearby has witnessed.

阅读就是让别人为你塑造世界。这是一种亲密的行为。当作者郁闷时，你也会变得郁闷。当他快乐时，最终你也能分享。读完一本非常好的书后，一个人会有点发疯，被迫从一个附近没有人见过的世界回来。

(Book clubs might spoil the effect. So might reading the same thing as everyone else. Choose carefully.)

（读书俱乐部可能会破坏效果。因此可能会与其他人阅读相同的内容。请谨慎选择。）

I have some suggestions on how to read well. If they are forceful it is simply because they are mine. Take what you wish.

我对如何读好书有一些建议。如果它们很强大，那只是因为它们是我的。拿走你想要的。

You should embrace the visceral quality in reading. Read mostly fiction. Read slowly. There is a kind of marinating that happens with very good works, they are always more than their story. The goal is not to digest information, but to layer over your reality with a fresh coat of moss. Your own world becomes colored by these stories, so it is worthwhile to spend time seeking the excellent works from across cultures and history.

你应该拥抱阅读中的本能品质。主要阅读小说。慢慢读。非常好的作品会发生一种腌制，它们总是不仅仅是故事。我们的目标不是消化信息，而是用一层新鲜的苔藓覆盖你的现实。你自己的世界因这些故事而变得丰富多彩，所以花时间寻找跨文化和历史的优秀作品是值得的。

You should have a goal, in some sense, to be influenced by the works that you read. A*ll stories* influence you, regardless of how they get to you. A person who reads no great stories will be influenced by the few stories he does come across in life, for better or worse — and I think mostly worse.

从某种意义上说，你应该有一个目标，即受到你所阅读的作品的影响。所有的故事都会影响你，无论它们是如何影响你的。一个不读伟大故事的人会受到他在生活中遇到的少数故事的影响，无论好坏——我认为大多数是更坏的。

If you read what is excellent you will not suddenly become excellent, but a life that is sown with stories is one better positioned to think and dream. The more stories, the more likely one is to understand and identify all the influences that act upon oneself in life.

如果你读了优秀的作品，你不会突然变得优秀，但播下故事的生活才更容易思考和梦想。故事越多，人们就越有可能理解和识别生活中对自己产生的所有影响。

*He who has no poetry in himself will find poetry in nothing.* A person that reads no stories is unready for life. A person that reads many stories will be open to yet more stories. The appetite grows by what it feeds on. Dine as best you can.

一个人本身没有诗意，他就会在虚无中找到诗意。一个不读故事的人还没有为生活做好准备。一个读过很多故事的人将会接受更多的故事。食欲随着食物的增加而增长。尽可能地吃饭。

You should start many books and complete few. You should never feel beholden to completing them, there are simply too many worthwhile works to read.

你应该开始读很多书，完成很少的书。你永远不应该觉得有义务完成它们，因为有太多值得阅读的作品。

You should re-read the books you adore. With a second reading you will realize just how much you have forgotten, how much you have absorbed, and how much you simply missed the first time, just like you miss any detail of life without [repetition](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/familiarity-and-belonging). I think this more important than any other suggestion. When you have found a masterpiece, you should reread it just as you would revisit a beloved foreign land, or a faraway friend.

你应该重读你喜欢的书。通过第二次阅读，你会意识到你忘记了多少，吸收了多少，以及你在第一次时错过了多少，就像你错过了生活中的任何细节而不重复一样。我认为这比任何其他建议都更重要。当你发现一部杰作时，你应该重读它，就像你重游心爱的异国他乡，或重游远方的朋友一样。

You should buy books on a whim, whenever possible, enough that you start to forget about them. You shouldn't know the whole contents of your own shelves. If you create a home library it should act as one: It is there for you to discover and rediscover, to get lost in. Sometimes you can start or continue a book only when the mood is right, so it is good to have a storehouse ready. But you should also prune the unworthy. A good garden needs both.

只要有可能，你应该随心所欲地买书，足以让你开始忘记它们。你不应该知道自己书架上的全部内容。如果你创建一个家庭图书馆，它应该充当一个角色：它在那里供你发现和重新发现，让你迷失其中。有时你只有在心情好的时候才能开始或继续一本书，所以拥有一个储藏室是件好事准备好。但你也应该修剪那些不值得的东西。一个好的花园需要两者兼而有之。

You should leave notes in the margins of books, for yourself upon rereading, or referencing, or for your children. Do not listen to the people who shrink from writing in books: If you buy it then it is on your shelf to serve you, and you should make the fullest use of it.

您应该在书本的页边空白处留下笔记，供自己重读时或参考时使用，或供您的孩子使用。不要听那些不敢写书的人的话：如果你买了它，它就在你的书架上为你服务，你应该充分利用它。

I find it edifying to read by era. For example I read these — over the course of years — not because they were on some list but simply because one begets interest in the next, and they build upon each other.

我发现按时代阅读很有启发性。例如，我读了这些——多年来——不是因为它们在某个清单上，而是因为其中一个引起了对下一个的兴趣，并且它们相互基础。

*Reflections on the Revolution in France* (Burke)

对法国革命的反思（伯克）

*Napoleon: A Life* (Andrew Roberts — twice, one of the best biographies I’ve read)

拿破仑：一生（安德鲁·罗伯茨——两次，我读过的最好的传记之一）

*Memoirs from beyond the Grave* (Chateaubriand)

坟墓之外的回忆录（夏多布里昂）

*Count of Monte Cristo* (Dumas)

基督山伯爵（大仲马）

*War and Peace* (Tolstoy — currently reading)

战争与和平（托尔斯泰——正在阅读）

(And perhaps next I will read Zweig’s biography of Fouché.)

（也许接下来我会读茨威格的富歇传记。）

Reading culturally adjacent works is especially rewarding. This should come as no surprise, context builds meaning, and opens subtleties that are inaccessible to outsiders. It helps, in the same way, to read around a work to better understand it: First a novel, then a biography of the author, then another novel of hers, etc.

阅读文化相邻的作品尤其有益。这应该不足为奇，上下文构建意义，并揭示外人无法理解的微妙之处。同样，阅读一部作品以更好地理解它也有帮助：首先是一本小说，然后是作者的传记，然后是她的另一部小说，等等。

Audiobooks are the modern lector:

有声读物是现代的讲师：

*fact check: we’re so back

事实核查：我们回来了*

I think audiobooks are too often ignored (or scoffed at) by some serious readers. They are quite underrated. [Quiet listening](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/quiet-listening-the-last-guest) is a skill, just like reading, that takes some practice. If you read like I do, very slowly with a voice in your head, you begin to catch the same feeling.

我认为有声读物经常被一些认真的读者忽视（或嘲笑）。他们被严重低估了。安静的倾听是一种技能，就像阅读一样，需要一些练习。如果你像我一样读得很慢，脑子里有一个声音，你就会开始感受到同样的感觉。

If you are too distracted to listen to audiobooks well, they are still an excellent way to *re-read* works that you have already read. Since you are already familiar with the work, re-reading by audiobook has little penalty for zoning out for a minute, or paying attention to the road, or other little context switches.

如果您分心而无法好好听有声读物，它们仍然是重读已读过的作品的绝佳方式。由于你已经熟悉了这部作品，因此重新阅读有声读物不会因为走神一分钟、或注意道路或其他小的上下文切换而受到影响。

Audiobooks vary tremendously in quality. The performer is almost as important as the author. It is worthwhile to seek out recommendations from a trusted friend or admired listener. I think in general older works lend themselves better to audio format, especially novels that were originally published as serials, like *The Count of Monte Cristo* and *War and Peace*, because the pacing of serialized novels necessitates some repetition. And of course old stories meant for oral retellings lean heavily on repetition, like The Odyssey,

and so also shine as audiobooks.

有声读物的质量差异很大。表演者几乎和作者一样重要。从值得信赖的朋友或钦佩的听众那里寻求建议是值得的。我认为一般来说，较旧的作品更适合音频格式，尤其是最初以连载形式出版的小说，例如《基督山伯爵》和《战争与和平》，因为连载小说的节奏需要一些重复。当然，用于口头复述的老故事在很大程度上依赖于重复，例如《奥德赛》、《奥德赛》3等，作为有声读物也很出色。

I am tempted occasionally to give broad recommendations on what to read, but I think this is usually a mistake. The best recommendations are always personal. There is usually some event or mood or season of life that makes one thing more poignant than another.

我偶尔会想就阅读内容提出广泛的建议，但我认为这通常是一个错误。最好的建议总是个性化的。通常，生活中的某些事件、心情或季节会让一件事比另一件事更令人心酸。

I should mention that I am not opposed to non-fiction. In fact I may like memoir — the rare good ones — most of all. But I think what is most valuable to read are the category of works that *resist summary*, and the commonplace nonfiction books rarely fulfill that. Of the worst offenders there is sometimes a book review that finds itself superior to the book.

我应该指出，我并不反对非小说类作品。事实上，我可能最喜欢回忆录——难得的好回忆录。但我认为最有价值的阅读是那些抗拒总结的作品，而普通的非小说类书籍很少能满足这一点。在最严重的罪犯中，有时会有一篇书评发现自己比这本书更优秀。

I also tend to stress fiction because I think, especially among my professional peers in the industry of software, that there is too great a fondness for non-fiction. I think this arises from a belief that superior knowledge of the world comes from non-fiction. This thought is attractive to people who build systems, but over-systematizing and seeing systems in everything can be a failure mode. Careful descriptions and summaries miss too much of the world. Hard distinctions make bad philosophy.

Reading fiction helps you become an *unsystematic* thinker, something that is equally valuable but more elided by some engineers. It is easy to maintain an intellectual rigidity. It takes more care to maintain a loose poeticism of thought.

我也倾向于强调小说，因为我认为，尤其是在软件行业的专业同行中，人们对非小说类作品的喜爱太大了。我认为这是源于一种信念，即对世界的高级知识来自非小说类作品。这种想法对于构建系统的人来说很有吸引力，但过度系统化和在一切事物中都看到系统可能是一种失败模式。细致的描述和总结漏掉了太多的世界。严格的区分会导致糟糕的哲学。 4 阅读小说可以帮助你成为一个非系统性的思考者，这同样有价值，但被一些工程师忽视了。保持智力上的僵化是很容易的。需要更加小心地保持思想的松散诗意。

I hope you find something magnificent to read.

我希望你能找到一些精彩的东西来阅读。
