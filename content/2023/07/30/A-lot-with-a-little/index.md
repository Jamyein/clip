Some works are better for their brevity.

有些作品因其简洁而更好。

Fan Ho, 1962 何藩, 1962

Fan Ho needs very little: Most of the image is black, or blurry. You can scarcely tell what materials you’re looking at. But the essential is there: A subject and a perspective that makes the scene almost haunting in its depth. That the rest is *not there* is to the benefit of the scene.

何凡需要的很少：大部分图像都是黑色的，或者是模糊的。你几乎无法分辨你正在看什么材料。但本质就在那里：一个主题和一个视角，使场景的深度几乎令人难以忘怀。其余部分不存在对场景有利。

*“Photography is stealing and lying”* a friend of mine would often declare, and partly she’s right. The canal probably did not quite have this effect in person. It may not have felt so claustrophobic, or narrow, or even particularly long. But in taking the photo Fan Ho does not capture all of what is there, that would be using too much. He zooms and captures a keyhole only, and makes it feel immense. In this way photography is like sculpting: You are not trying to fit a scene with everything, with as much information as possible, but a scene where there is little else to take away.

我的一个朋友经常说“摄影就是偷窃和撒谎”，她在一定程度上是对的。运河本身可能并没有产生这种效果。它可能不会让人感觉那么幽闭恐怖、狭窄，甚至特别长。但何帆在拍照时并没有捕捉到所有的东西，那样就太过了。他只放大并捕捉到一个锁孔，并使其感觉巨大。从这个意义上说，摄影就像雕塑：你并不是试图让一个场景包含所有的东西，包含尽可能多的信息，而是一个没有其他东西可以带走的场景。

In doing this Ho is capable of showing more than is really there. The scene is not merely descriptive but suggestive, it seeks to engage our imagination, I think it does this, though it may not feel obvious when it is happening. It is only because our personal visual imagination is already well-developed that it works, and he knows this, so it involves us and enchants. This is the aim of much good art.

通过这样做，何能够展示出比实际情况更多的东西。这个场景不仅是描述性的，而且是暗示性的，它试图激发我们的想象力，我认为它做到了这一点，尽管它发生时可能感觉不明显。只是因为我们个人的视觉想象力已经很发达，它才起作用，而他知道这一点，所以它让我们参与并着迷。这是许多优秀艺术的目标。

The same is true for poetry, a few careful words say more than what is in them. Some examples from Japanese *senryu* come to mind. Unlike the more familiar *haiku*, which tend to dwell on seasons and nature in a somber tone, senyru are most often about human nature, and can be quite ribald. Many old examples are anonymous. A few from the 1700’s:

诗也是如此，几句小心的话，胜过其中的内容。我想到了日本senryu的一些例子。与人们更熟悉的俳句不同，俳句往往以忧郁的语气描写季节和自然，而俳句通常是关于人性的，而且可能相当粗俗。许多老例子都是匿名的。 1700年代的一些：

> the doctor has a cold
> 
> 医生感冒了
> 
> but he's eating noodle soup
> 
> 但他正在吃汤面
> 
> and resting in bed 
> 
> 并躺在床上休息

The meaning is simply implied — the author knows our minds can complete the picture. This works because, then as now, across cultures, it is easy to suspect that the doctor knows his complex prescriptions are not particularly useful.

其含义很简单——作者知道我们的头脑可以完成这幅画。这是有效的，因为无论过去还是现在，跨文化，人们很容易怀疑医生知道他的复杂处方并不是特别有用。

Just as everyone knows such a person:

正如大家都认识这样一个人：

> the grumbler 
> 
> 发牢骚者
> 
> finally stands up to leave
> 
> 终于站起来离开
> 
> then grumbles for an hour
> 
> 然后抱怨了一个小时

And other persons: 

以及其他人：

> whatever he says 
> 
> 不管他说什么
> 
> is discounted by fifty percent
> 
> 折扣百分之五十
> 
> by anyone who listens 
> 
> 给任何听的人

> "Keep it to yourself" “你自己留着”
> he says — to how many people
> 他说——对多少人
> nobody knows 没人知道

And I suppose everyone understands,

而且我想大家都明白，

> the clerk and the maid

> 店员和女仆
> 
> are not on speaking terms—
> 
> 不谈得来——
> 
> in the daytime, that is

When you have some trust in your audiences’ innate knowledge, you can strip away everything but the essential part you want to focus. When you give this trust you can allow your reader to dwell. The amateur is often guilty of explaining too much. Art can become great when the artist finds a way to explain less. Precisely by requiring more of us does art elevates the human experience.

当你对观众的固有知识有一定的信任时，你可以去掉所有内容，只留下你想要关注的重要部分。当你给予这种信任时，你就可以让你的读者驻足停留。业余爱好者常常会因为解释太多而感到内疚。当艺术家找到一种减少解释的方法时，艺术就会变得伟大。正是通过对我们提出更多要求，艺术才提升了人类的体验。

That is my only thought tonight. But while we are here together, why not one more photograph from Fan Ho?

这是我今晚唯一的想法。但当我们在一起的时候，为什么不再拍一张何藩的照片呢？

This is my favorite of his work. The subject, the little girl, is subtle enough that the viewer might not see her in the first instant, but only in the seconds afterwards when one’s eyes begin to wander about the details. She has made the tiny balcony into her own room, and from this much life can be imagined. Is she at play or work? Fan Ho has his own suggestion, or perhaps he knows: the picture is titled *Her Study.*

这是我最喜欢他的作品。这个小女孩这个主题非常微妙，观众可能在第一瞬间看不到她，但只有在几秒钟后当人们的眼睛开始在细节上徘徊时才能看到她。她把小小的阳台变成了自己的房间，这样的生活可想而知了。她是在玩还是在工作？何帆有他自己的建议，或许他知道：这幅画的标题是《她的书房》。

The puff of smoke is almost too perfect. The indifferent activity of the city fails to bother the girl. She has her own world that she is mastering. It is not the photograph but the child that makes a lot with a little.

烟雾几乎太完美了。城市的冷漠活动并没有让这个女孩感到困扰。她有自己的世界，她正在掌控。事半功倍的不是照片，而是孩子。
