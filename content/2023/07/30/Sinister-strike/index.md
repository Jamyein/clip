Left-handedness is bad for you, apes are all ambidextrous, hominids are somewhat right-handed

and today only 8%-10% of the population uses the left. This means that there has been a long ongoing selection for the use of the right, we can see in cohort data that this process of selection has continued until recent times. Even today there are genetic correlations between [genes that reduce fitness, that is variants that cause psychiatric illness, and left-handedness.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32989287/)

左撇子对你不利，猿类都是双手灵巧的，原始人类有些右利手1，而今天只有 8%-10% 的人口使用左手。这意味着对权利的使用有一个长期持续的选择，我们可以从队列数据中看到，这个选择过程一直持续到最近。即使在今天，降低健康水平的基因（即导致精神疾病的变异）与左撇子之间仍然存在遗传相关性。

So if LH is bad for your fitness why is it still around? (~also if we all came from ambidextrous apes how come there are still ambidextrous apes around?~) After all, there have been millions of years for selection to operate and raise RH to fixation. The answer must be that LH holds some advantages that have kept the trait ongoing in the population in non-trivial frequencies.

那么，如果 LH 对您的健康有害，为什么它仍然存在呢？ （而且，如果我们都来自灵巧的猿类，为什么周围仍然存在灵巧的猿类？）毕竟，已经有数百万年的时间进行选择操作并将 RH 提高到固着。答案一定是，LH 拥有一些优势，使得该特征在人群中以非平凡的频率持续存在。

One theory for LH advantage is [“Frequency-Dependent Maintenance of Left-Handedness in Humans”](https://www.jstor.org/stable/50649) by Michel Raymond, the idea is that in groups that face high rates of physical combat being left-handed may grant an advantage because a left-swinger is used to fighting right-swingers, who are more common in the population, while they are not used to fighting him. Under those conditions, the rate of left-handedness will rise in the population until it will become common enough to eliminate the advantage of having an unusual fighting style.

左撇子优势的一种理论是米歇尔·雷蒙德（Michel Raymond）的“人类左撇子的频率相关维持”，其想法是，在面临高频率身体战斗的群体中，左撇子可能会带来优势，因为使用了左撇子与右翼分子作斗争，右翼分子在人口中更为常见，但他们不习惯与他作斗争。在这种情况下，左撇子在人口中的比例将会上升，直到它变得足够普遍以消除具有不寻常战斗风格的优势。

Several things are going for this theory, The fiercer sex is more LH than the fairer sex. In the largest study on this subject, a national geographic survey of 1.4 million Americans, LH was 25% more common in men than in women and that difference remained constant across birth cohorts

.

这个理论有几个方面的依据：凶猛的性别比公平的性别有更多的黄体生成素。在关于这一主题的最大研究（对 140 万美国人进行的国家地理调查）中，男性 LH 的发生率比女性高 25%，并且这种差异在不同出生队列中保持不变 2。

There is a large over-representation of LH in sports in which the athletes are facing an opponent, while the same is not true for sports in which athletes are bowling alone.

在运动员面对对手的运动中，LH 的比例过高，而在运动员单独打保龄球的运动中，情况并非如此。

This data from Raymond’s original article and further studies have confirmed it, such as this study of senior athletes in the top 200 rankings:

Raymond 原始文章中的数据和进一步的研究都证实了这一点，例如这项针对前 200 名排名中的高级运动员的研究：

Looking at fighters in particular, a study of 13,800 professional boxers and mixed martial artists showed not only greater LH among fighters but also a higher probability of winning. (although over-representation in a sport may constitute better evidence for greater ability than higher probability for victory, this is because one can imagine a situation in which enough left-handers enter a sport until LH is no longer an advantage)

特别是针对拳击手，一项针对 13,800 名职业拳击手和综合格斗艺术家的研究表明，拳击手不仅 LH 更高，而且获胜的可能性也更高。 （虽然在一项运动中过多的代表可能比更高的获胜概率更能证明能力更强，但这是因为人们可以想象这样一种情况，即有足够多的左撇子进入一项运动，直到左撇子不再是一种优势）

Left-handed fighters are above the 0.5 line marking over 50% probability of victory

左撇子战士在 0.5 线以上，胜利概率超过 50%

People’s natural intuitions are in line with this, among people who thought handedness mattered for the chance of winning a fight, 79.8% thought left-handers were more likely to win.

人们的自然直觉与此相符，在认为惯用手对打架胜率影响很大的人中，79.8%的人认为左撇子更有可能赢得3场比赛。

If the present intution of Lefties’ combat ability extended to the past, It may explain some peculiar historical references such as when Judges 20:16 brag about having 700 left-handed warriors who could ‘sling a stone at a hair and not miss’ and when Chronicles 12:2 reference bowmen who were ambidextrous.

如果现在对左撇子战斗能力的直觉延伸到过去，它可能会解释一些特殊的历史参考文献，例如士师记 20:16 吹嘘有 700 名左撇子战士，他们可以“向头发投掷石头而不会失手”，以及历代志 12:2 提到弓箭手都是双手灵巧的。

It could also offer some explanation about anti-left-handed bias, the common custom of a handshake, likely invented to present peaceful intentions by showing the dominant hand is not carrying a weapon, fails with lefties and the checking of weapons on the right side of the body has not saved Eglon, king of Moab from being stabbed by Ehud the israelite

(If you ask me the king’s guards were slacking off).

它还可以对反左撇子偏见提供一些解释，握手的常见习俗，可能是为了通过显示惯用的手没有携带武器来表达和平意图而发明的，但左撇子会失败，并且检查右侧的武器身体的一部分并没有拯救摩押国王埃格隆免于被以色列人埃胡德刺伤

（如果你问我，国王的卫兵正在懈怠）。

If the frequency of LH is maintained due to a combat advantage, do we see elevated levels of LH among some highly violent societies? there is some non-conclusive for this, in a small sample of traditional societies higher rates of LH are seen in tribal groups with higher rates of homicide (Handedness here is not the writing hand but the knife/machete hand or tool-using hand). Interestingly, the Yanomamo, A group in which Napoleon Chagnon showed Men who committed homicide have higher rates of reproductive success, have the highest rates of LH.

如果由于战斗优势而保持 LH 的频率，那么我们是否会在一些高度暴力的社会中看到 LH 水平升高？对此有一些非定论，在传统社会的小样本中，凶杀率较高的部落群体中 LH 率较高（这里的惯用手不是写字的手，而是刀/砍刀的手或使用工具的手） 。有趣的是，Yanomamo（拿破仑·查尼翁 (Napoleon Chagnon) 证明犯有杀人罪的男性具有更高的繁殖成功率 5 的群体）的 LH 率最高。

We can look at some further tentative data, possibly there is a way to compare LH in agricultural and pre-agricultural societies. A reconstruction of LH in historical societies was created by looking at statues and paintings in which a tool or a weapon is in use:

我们可以进一步看一些初步数据，也许有一种方法可以比较农业社会和前农业社会的 LH。通过观察使用工具或武器的雕像和绘画，重建了历史社会 6 中的 LH：

This could be compared to reconstructions of handedness in pre-agricultural societies, done by comparing the frequency of left-handed hand stencils to right-handed hand stencils in cave painting:

这可以与前农业社会中利手习惯的重建进行比较，通过比较洞穴壁画 7 中左手模板和右手模板的频率来完成：

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F61c4ffdb-074b-4811-b2fd-a8a3a12ac667_602x468.png)

The assumption here is that the left-handed painted right-hand stencils and vice versa, but there are some problems of interpretation here, “[Faurie C, Raymond M. (2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1809976/)” got a group of people to draw hand stencils with a blow-pipe and got frequencies consistent with those in the Gravettian caves, this was because the left-handed people draw right-handed stencils while the right-handed did not do the reverse as much. While in some respect such an experiment is very compelling on the other ~hand~ side it’s hard to see these results as anything but the consequence of chance, it is also not clear how such an experiment would replicate in various caves with differing proportions of left and right prints. N. Uomini & J. Steele also mention criticism of the experiment, pointing out that the placement and orientation of various prints in the cave would make it impossible to paint them using a blow-pipe which would make it harder for people to make a print of their dominant hand.

这里的假设是左手画右手模板，反之亦然，但这里存在一些解释问题，“Faurie C, Raymond M. (2003)”让一群人用打击画手模板-pipe 并得到与 Gravettian 洞穴中的频率一致的频率，这是因为左撇子绘制右手模板，而右手则没有做那么多相反的事情。虽然在某些方面这样的实验非常引人注目，但另一方面，很难将这些结果视为除了偶然的结果之外的任何结果，也不清楚这样的实验如何在左右比例不同的各种洞穴中复制印刷。 N. Uomini 和 J. Steele 8 也提到了对该实验的批评，指出洞穴中各种指纹的放置和方向将使得无法使用吹管来绘制它们，这将使人们更难制作他们的惯用手的印记。

So the Left-handed advantage in violence seems fairly well supported by the athletic studies while its effect on the proportion of LH across various populations has something going for it, but more stabbing are needed.

因此，左撇子在暴力方面的优势似乎得到了体育研究的充分支持，而它对不同人群中左撇子比例的影响也有一定的道理，但还需要更多的刺伤。
