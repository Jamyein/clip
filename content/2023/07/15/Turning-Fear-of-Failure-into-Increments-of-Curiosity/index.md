When I was younger, I badly wanted to live in Japan. Japan is a country with very strict immigration laws, but my university had an exchange program where you could go spend a semester and study in another country.  

当我年轻的时候，我非常想住在日本。日本是一个移民法非常严格的国家，但我的大学有一个交换项目，你可以去另一个国家度过一个学期并学习。

There was only one problem: the Japanese university they had a partnership with was one of the most selective in the country. I remember thinking: “There is no way I’ll get accepted.”  

只有一个问题：他们合作的日本大学是该国最挑剔的大学之一。我记得我当时想：“我不可能被录取。”

I told my mom about my doubts.  

我把我的疑惑告诉了妈妈。

“It’s not your decision to make,” she said.  

“这不是你的决定，”她说。

And, as often, she was right. We constantly limit our options by deciding for others. All I had to do was apply, and it then became the university’s job to accept my application or not.  

而且，一如既往，她是对的。我们通过为他人做决定来不断限制我们的选择。我所要做的就是申请，然后接受或不接受我的申请就成为大学的工作。

You probably have seen this pattern countless times in yourself and others. It’s far easier not to fail when you haven’t tried. It’s far easier to not be wrong when you’re not putting yourself out there. But it’s also much harder to grow as a human being when we avoid getting out of our comfort zone.  

您可能在自己和他人身上无数次地看到过这种模式。当你没有尝试过时，不失败要容易得多。当你不把自己暴露在外时，就更容易不犯错。但当我们避免走出舒适区时，作为一个人的成长也会变得更加困难。

If this fear of failure is so bad for our personal and professional growth, why is it so common?  

如果这种对失败的恐惧对我们的个人和职业成长如此不利，为什么它如此普遍？

## We all want to be loved  

我们都希望被爱

Fear of failure starts in early childhood. We are social animals and feel the need to be accepted by others, which begins with the acceptance and love of our parents. In a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029210000063) looking at the relationship between young athletes and their parents, researchers found a correlation between the parents’ high expectations for achievement and the children’s fear of failure. The more the parents showed a negative reaction to what they perceived as a failure from their kid, the more the kid would fear the consequences of “failing.”  

对失败的恐惧从童年时期就开始了。我们是群居动物，需要被他人接受，这首先要从父母的接受和爱开始。在一项针对年轻运动员与其父母之间关系的研究中，研究人员发现父母对成就的高期望与孩子对失败的恐惧之间存在相关性。父母对孩子的失败表现出越负面的反应，孩子就越害怕“失败”的后果。

In some people, this can turn into atychiphobia, an irrational and paralyzing fear of failure, often accompanied by an intense feeling of panic or anxiety, and physical symptoms such as difficulty breathing, an unusually fast heart rate, and sweating.  

对于某些人来说，这可能会变成无性恐惧症，这是一种对失败的非理性和令人麻痹的恐惧，通常伴随着强烈的恐慌或焦虑感，以及呼吸困难、心率异常快和出汗等身体症状。

For most people, though, fear of failure manifests itself in a much more subtle way, mainly self-doubt that prevents us from exploring uncertain paths:  

然而，对于大多数人来说，对失败的恐惧以一种更微妙的方式表现出来，主要是自我怀疑，阻止我们探索不确定的道路：

-   We put off doing things because we’re unsure how they will turn out.  
    我们推迟做某事是因为我们不确定结果如何。
-   We avoid situations where we may have to try something new in front of other people.  
    我们避免可能需要在其他人面前尝试新事物的情况。
-   We avoid doing things we know will improve our lives because we don’t have all the necessary skills.  
    我们避免做那些我们知道会改善我们生活的事情，因为我们不具备所有必要的技能。
-   We give ourselves the illusion of growth by reading, researching, watching videos… Anything but doing the thing and risking being judged by others.  
    我们通过阅读、研究、观看视频等方式给自己一种成长的错觉……除了冒着被别人评判的风险去做事情之外，我们什么都做不了。

But the good news is that nobody is hoping for you to fail. Most people you know would be happy to see you succeed, and the ones who don’t know you don’t care. So how can you shift your perception and overcome your fear of failure?  

但好消息是，没有人希望你失败。大多数你认识的人都会很高兴看到你成功，而那些不认识你的人则不在乎。那么你如何才能改变你的看法并克服对失败的恐惧呢？

## Your perception of possible  

您对可能性的看法

When you start reading a novel, you rarely expect to finish it in one go. Instead, you will probably read a few chapters, then a few more, until you’re done with the book.  

当你开始读一本小说时，你很少期望一口气读完它。相反，你可能会读几章，然后再读几章，直到读完这本书。

Strangely, we’re not so pragmatic when it comes to personal goals.  

奇怪的是，当谈到个人目标时，我们并不那么务实。

It’s common to look at a long-term goal and never get started because it seems too far out of reach. But we can reshape our perception of what’s possible by breaking our journey into smaller, more achievable chunks.  

着眼于长期目标却从未开始的情况很常见，因为它看起来太遥不可及。但我们可以通过将我们的旅程分成更小、更容易实现的部分来重塑我们对可能性的看法。

Achievable, in this case, does not mean something where you are certain of succeeding, but rather something that you can put to the test in the short term, without being able to use any excuse to put it off.  

在这种情况下，可实现并不意味着你确信会成功，而是指你可以在短期内进行测试，而不能使用任何借口来推迟它。

Let’s say you have a fear of public speaking and use the excuse that, in any case, nobody has ever invited you to speak at a conference. A small, achievable experiment would be to apply to five local meetups to give a talk. While speaking in public may sound terrifying, filling out an online form is perfectly doable.  

假设您害怕公开演讲，并以无论如何都没有人邀请您在会议上发言为借口。一个小型的、可实现的实验是申请到五个当地聚会进行演讲。虽然在公共场合演讲可能听起来很可怕，但填写在线表格是完全可行的。

Similarly, you may be scared to be judged for the quality of your writing. While writing a book is a daunting task that is easy to hide behind (“I’d love to write a book, but I don’t have the time”), writing a blog post is much more manageable.  

同样，您可能害怕别人对您的写作质量进行评判。虽然写书是一项艰巨的任务，很容易隐藏（“我很想写一本书，但我没有时间”），但写博客文章更容易管理。

## Fail like a scientist  

像科学家一样失败

If you see life as a giant experiment where your goal is to explore as much as you can to obtain answers to your questions, failure becomes an investment to get closer to these answers. In the words of Seth Godin: “The cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing.”  

如果你将生活视为一个巨大的实验，你的目标是尽可能多地探索以获得问题的答案，那么失败就变成了一种接近这些答案的投资。用赛斯·戈丁的话来说：“犯错的成本比什么都不做的成本要低。”

Scientists often repeat experiments thousands of times to get a conclusive answer. And more often than not, the answer they get is that their initial hypothesis was wrong. Not performing the experiment would have allowed them to stay in a cozy limbo of being *not wrong*, but then we wouldn’t have any science.  

科学家们经常重复实验数千次才能得到结论性的答案。通常，他们得到的答案是他们最初的假设是错误的。不进行实验会让他们处于一种没有错的舒适状态，但那样我们就不会有任何科学依据。

This is why approaching failure like a scientist is so powerful. By making decisions that will let you [learn something new](https://nesslabs.com/learning-how-to-learn), you are guaranteed to be successful—where success is learning, evolving, and growing as a human being. Failing becomes a way to cultivate aliveness.  

这就是为什么像科学家一样对待失败如此强大。通过做出能让你学习新东西的决定，你一定会成功——成功就是作为一个人学习、进化和成长。失败成为培养活力的一种方式。

## Increments of curiosity 好奇心的增加

Another way to approach your fear of failure is to think like a kid. Children tend to experiment just for the sake of it: What will happen if I press this button? How does it feel to touch this thing?  

消除对失败恐惧的另一种方法是像孩子一样思考。孩子们往往只是为了尝试而进行实验：如果我按下这个按钮会发生什么？触摸这个东西感觉如何？

Reconnecting with your inner child is a great way to overcome your fear of failure. For example: What will happen if I publish this post? How does it feel to speak my mind?  

与内心的孩子重新建立联系是克服对失败的恐惧的好方法。例如：如果我发布这篇文章会发生什么？说出我的想法感觉如何？

Instead of imagining all the ways you may fail, turn your doubts into questions. Maybe nothing good will happen, but a child would not take the answer for granted.  

不要想象你可能会失败的所有方式，而要把你的怀疑变成问题。也许不会有什么好事发生，但孩子不会认为答案是理所当然的。

Start with something small, then move on to another iteration—a bigger [growth loop](https://nesslabs.com/growth-loops). With time, your mind will become increasingly comfortable with trying new things and constantly expanding your horizons.  

从小事开始，然后进行另一个迭代——更大的增长循环。随着时间的推移，你的思维会变得越来越乐于尝试新事物并不断拓展你的视野。

Practically, here is how you can start applying this approach of deliberate experimentation right now:  

实际上，您现在可以开始应用这种刻意实验的方法：

1.  **Pick something you’ve been putting off because of your fear of failure.** Is it public speaking? Starting a blog? Producing a podcast? Launching your first product? Write it down.  
    选择一些你因为害怕失败而一直推迟的事情。是公开演讲吗？开始写博客？制作播客？推出您的第一个产品？写下来。
2.  **Define one small experiment you can design to explore this fear.** It should be actionable. For example, apply to a few meetups to give a talk, produce one episode of a podcast, or write an article as a Google Doc and share it with a few friends. It should be simple enough that you can just do it in a few hours at most.  
    定义一个你可以设计的小实验来探索这种恐惧。它应该是可操作的。例如，申请参加一些聚会进行演讲、制作一集播客，或者以 Google 文档的形式写一篇文章并与几个朋友分享。它应该足够简单，最多几个小时就可以完成。
3.  **Do it!** Don’t plan anything. Don’t research the best way to go about it. Don’t announce it on Twitter. Just do it.  
    做吧！不要计划任何事情。不要研究解决问题的最佳方法。不要在 Twitter 上宣布。去做就对了。
4.  **Reflect on what happened.** Any negative reactions? What about your emotions? What did you learn? Write all of these thoughts down. It’s a great way to practice [metacognition](https://nesslabs.com/metacognition).  
    反思一下发生了什么。有什么负面反应吗？你的情绪呢？你学到了什么？把所有这些想法写下来。这是练习元认知的好方法。
5.  **Rinse and repeat.** Keep defining incremental steps in the form of experiments that fall out of your comfort zone but are not scary to the point of being paralyzing. Again, avoid overthinking it beforehand. Just do it, and reflect only after you have performed the experiment.  
    冲洗并重复。继续以实验的形式定义渐进的步骤，这些步骤会超出你的舒适区，但不会吓到瘫痪的地步。再次强调，避免事先考虑太多。就去做吧，只有在完成实验后才进行反思。

You may feel some anxiety or discomfort along the way, but addressing your fears and trying new things you care about is the best way to avoid another feeling that’s much harder to manage: regret.  

一路上你可能会感到一些焦虑或不适，但解决你的恐惧并尝试你关心的新事物是避免另一种更难控制的感觉的最佳方法：后悔。
