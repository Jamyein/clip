In this memo, I outline Amp It Up — the management philosophy I apply to Write of Passage. It has three pillars: increase the tempo, raise the standards, and narrow the focus. When you Amp It Up, people radiate ambition, urgency, boldness, and Hearts on Fire.  

在这份备忘录中，我概述了 Amp It Up——我应用于 Write of Passage 的管理理念。它具有三个支柱：加快节奏、提高标准和缩小焦点。当你把它放大时，人们会散发出雄心、紧迫感、勇气和热情。

How do you build a high-performing company?   

如何打造一家高绩效公司？

Frank Slootman has answers. He’s led three companies to their IPOs: Data Domain, Service Now, and Snowflake. Slootman turned around these high-potential companies by implementing his “Amp It Up” philosophy, which he’s spoken about in his [book](https://amzn.to/3WNP6h2), [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/amp-up-frank-slootman), and most of his podcasts.   

弗兰克·斯洛特曼有答案。他带领三家公司进行了首次公开募股：Data Domain、Service Now 和 Snowflake。斯洛特曼通过实施他的“Amp It Up”理念扭转了这些高潜力公司的局面，他在他的书、本文和大部分播客中都谈到了这一理念。

Amp It Up has three pillars: increase the tempo, raise the standards, and narrow the focus.   

Amp It Up 具有三大支柱：加快节奏、提高标准和缩小焦点。

This memo is a synopsis of his best ideas, with a particular focus on how we can apply them at Write of Passage. I’ve also shared this memo with friends and fellow founders outside the organization.   

这份备忘录是他最好的想法的概要，特别关注我们如何在 Write of Passage 中应用它们。我还与组织外部的朋友和其他创始人分享了这份备忘录。

## **Slootman’s Amp It Up Philosophy ** 

**Slootman 的 Amp It Up 理念**

### 1\. Increase the Tempo  

1\. 加快节奏

Without effective leadership, companies become sluggish as they grow. Malaise sets in. People become risk-averse. “I’ll do it right now” turns into “I’ll do it tomorrow,” which turns into “I’ll get it to you next week,” which turns into “Oops, I forgot about that.”   

如果没有有效的领导，企业的发展就会变得迟缓。人们开始厌恶风险。 “我现在就做”变成“我明天做”，变成“我下周给你”，变成“哎呀，我忘了。”

It’s a leader’s job to prevent stasis. You have to inject the organization with energy and intensity.   

防止停滞是领导者的工作。你必须为组织注入活力和强度。

When people say they’ll get back to you in a week, ask them why not tomorrow or the next day? It doesn’t matter if your request is unreasonable. The point of the question is to increase people’s sense of urgency. When you change an organization’s tempo, people demand more from each other, which is the essence of a high-performing organization.   

当人们说他们会在一周内回复你时，问他们为什么不明天或后天呢？如果你的要求不合理也没关系。提出这个问题的目的是要增强人们的紧迫感。当你改变组织的节奏时，人们对彼此的要求就会更高，这就是高绩效组织的本质。

Increasing the tempo isn’t just about speed. It’s also about rejecting incrementalism.  

提高节奏不仅仅是速度。这也是关于拒绝渐进主义。

People who work incrementally inch forward instead of taking bold leaps. They make timid decisions because they’re risk-averse. They work from a place of fear because screw-ups at most companies are so severely punished. But if you only aim for marginal improvements, you’ll only make marginal progress. Incrementalism will kill your company, gradually sinking it into stasis and stagnation.  

人们会循序渐进地前进，而不是大胆跨越。他们做出胆怯的决定是因为他们厌恶风险。他们在恐惧中工作，因为大多数公司的失误都会受到严厉的惩罚。但如果你只追求边际改进，那么你只会取得边际进步。渐进主义会杀死你的公司，逐渐使其陷入停滞和停滞。  

Avoiding risk is the riskiest strategy of all. Companies, like living organisms, need to constantly reinvent themselves.[^1]

避免风险是所有策略中风险最大的。公司就像生物体一样，需要不断地重塑自我。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://clip.citrusea.cc/2023/07/15/Amp-It-Up/index.html#footnotes" data-type="internal" data-id="#footnotes">1</a></sup>

Push people to achieve their goals way faster than they think is possible. The need for speed inspires innovation. Ask somebody to do something 20% faster, and they’ll use conventional strategies. Linear progress is the best you’ll get. But if you ask them to do something 2,000% faster, they’ll have to question all their base-level assumptions and innovate.  

推动人们以比他们想象的更快的速度实现目标。对速度的需求激发了创新。要求某人做某事的速度提高 20%，他们会使用传统策略。线性进步是你能得到的最好的结果。但如果你要求他们做某件事的速度提高 2,000%，他们就必须质疑所有基本假设并进行创新。

Here are some [questions](https://longform.asmartbear.com/posts/extreme-questions/?ck_subscriber_id=391421273&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=The+one+change+to+make+in+2023+-+9952474) we can ask, all of which are useful *because* they’re so dramatic:    

以下是我们可以提出的一些问题，所有这些问题都很有用，因为它们非常引人注目：

-   How can you achieve your 10-year vision in the next six months?  
    您如何在未来六个月内实现您的十年愿景？
-   If we could only work one day per week, how would we change our approach?   
    如果我们每周只能工作一天，我们会如何改变我们的方法？
-   What’s the most fun project we could possibly take on?   
    我们可以开展的最有趣的项目是什么？
-   If all our existing marketing channels disappeared, how would we reach customers?   
    如果我们现有的所有营销渠道都消失了，我们如何接触客户？
-   What product feature would justify a 10x increase in prices?    
    哪些产品功能可以证明价格上涨 10 倍是合理的？
-   If we had 10x the money, what would we do differently?  
    如果我们有十倍的钱，我们会采取什么不同的做法？

The slower a company moves, the more people suffer from the “End of History Illusion,” where they think the company’s reached its apex of progress. Speed of innovation shows people how radically different the future can be. Fighting The End of History Illusion is why Jeff Bezos wrote “It’s Always Day 1” in his first shareholder letter. At Amazon, he worked in a building called Day 1, and he took the name with him when he moved offices.[^2]

公司发展得越慢，就有越多的人遭受“历史终结幻觉”的困扰，他们认为公司已经达到了进步的顶峰。创新的速度向人们展示了未来有多么的不同。与历史终结幻想作斗争是杰夫·贝佐斯在他的第一封股东信中写下“永远是第一天”的原因。在亚马逊，他在一座名为 Day 1 的大楼里工作，当他搬迁办公室时，他也带着这个名字。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">2</a></sup>

Speed matters in business. Day 1 companies make quick, high-quality decisions. Day 2 companies make them slowly. Day 2 companies are slow because they’re culturally uncomfortable making decisions with limited information. Bezos says most decisions should be made with roughly 70% of the information you wish you had. If you’re always waiting for 90%, you’ll move too slowly. And besides, the costs of being wrong are usually less than you think, so long as you quickly course-correct.[^3] 

速度在商业中很重要。第一天公司就做出快速、高质量的决策。第二天公司慢慢地制作它们。第二天的公司进展缓慢，因为他们在文化上不习惯利用有限的信息做出决策。贝索斯表示，大多数决策应该根据您希望掌握的大约 70% 的信息来做出。如果你总是等待 90%，你就会进展得太慢。此外，只要你能迅速纠正方向，犯错的代价通常比你想象的要低。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">3</a></sup>

Increasing the tempo isn’t just about working harder. You need to change how you work too. The need for speed is one reason why we have a meeting-skeptical culture at Write of Passage. A team member recently called for a kickoff meeting to initiate a production project. I immediately jumped in. Why meet in five days when you can spend five minutes writing down what assets you need, and start the project 24 hours later? In the end, we finished the project before the kickoff meeting would’ve even happened.   

加快节奏不仅仅是更加努力地工作。你也需要改变你的工作方式。对速度的需求是我们在 Write of Passage 拥有会议怀疑文化的原因之一。一名团队成员最近呼吁召开启动会议来启动一个生产项目。我立即加入进来。当您可以花五分钟写下您需要的资产并在 24 小时后启动项目时，为什么要在五天之内开会呢？最终，我们在启动会议召开之前就完成了该项目。

When a meeting needs to happen, we make sure it happens well. Preparedness enables speed, which is why every meeting needs an agenda linked in the invite. If there’s a meeting on my calendar without one, I’ll cancel it.   

当需要召开会议时，我们会确保会议顺利进行。准备工作可以提高速度，这就是为什么每次会议都需要在邀请中链接议程的原因。如果我的日历上有一个会议没有，我会取消它。

A clear vision is another way to fight incrementalism. The early slogan for the iPod mini was “1,000 songs in your pocket.” The clearer and more ambitious the vision, the less you can succeed with incremental thinking. This is one reason why we value clear writing so much at Write of Passage. When an organization’s mission is well defined, people feel it down to their bones. They’ll fight for the company.   

清晰的愿景是对抗渐进主义的另一种方式。 iPod mini 的早期口号是“口袋里有 1,000 首歌曲”。愿景越清晰、越雄心勃勃，渐进式思维就越不可能取得成功。这就是为什么我们在 Write of Passage 中如此重视清晰的写作的原因之一。当一个组织的使命被明确定义时，人们就会从骨子里感受到它。他们会为公司而战。

Think of the SpaceX employees who move their families to Brownsville, Texas so they can someday make humanity a multi-planetary species. Incremental thinking won’t get people to Mars either. The grandeur of the mission led SpaceX to build reusable rockets. Until then, astronauts only wanted to fly in new rockets. They didn’t trust ones that’d been used before. Now they prefer ones that’ve been used before because they’re “battle-tested.” Launches are also an order of magnitude cheaper now that you don’t need to build a new rocket every time you want to go to space.  

想想那些举家搬到德克萨斯州布朗斯维尔的 SpaceX 员工，这样他们有一天就能让人类成为一个多行星物种。渐进式思维也无法让人们登上火星。这项伟大的任务促使 SpaceX 建造可重复使用的火箭。在那之前，宇航员只想乘坐新火箭飞行。他们不信任以前用过的那些。现在他们更喜欢以前用过的东西，因为它们是“经过考验的”。现在，发射成本也便宜了一个数量级，因为您不需要每次想去太空时都建造新的火箭。

Move fast, but don’t rush. Compress cycle times. Everything speeds up once the cadence changes. With speed comes energy and a culture of Hearts on Fire.  

动作要快，但不要着急。压缩周期时间。一旦节奏改变，一切都会加快。速度带来能量和 Hearts on Fire 文化。

### 2\. Raise the Standards  

2\. 提高标准

I’ll never forget a conference I once attended, hosted by Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. When I showed up, I was handed a white card with eight bullet points. The first seven had standard information like meal times and lodging directions. It was the point at the bottom that caught my attention. It said, “If anything isn’t *impeccably perfect*, please contact me immediately.”  

我永远不会忘记我曾经参加过的一次由 Stripe 首席执行官 Patrick Collison 主持的会议。当我出现时，我收到了一张白卡，上面有八个要点。前七个有标准信息，例如用餐时间和住宿方向。底部的那个点引起了我的注意。上面写着：“如果有什么不完美的地方，请立即联系我。”

Most conferences would’ve written “if something is wrong.” Patrick’s standard was much higher. If this was the standard he brought to a casual weekend conference, imagine the one he brings to Stripe.   

大多数会议都会写“如果出现问题”。帕特里克的标准要高得多。如果这是他在周末休闲会议上采用的标准，想象一下他在 Stripe 上采用的标准。

Steve Jobs had the same high standards. He had two classifications for quality: “insanely great” or “total shit.” There was no middle ground. A company’s propensity to cave to the creep of mediocrity is determined by what they deem acceptable. Leaders must refuse mediocre outcomes.   

史蒂夫·乔布斯也有同样的高标准。他对质量有两种分类：“非常好”或“完全是狗屎”。没有中间立场。一家公司是否会屈服于平庸，取决于他们认为什么是可以接受的。领导者必须拒绝平庸的结果。

People usually know when their work is mediocre. When people present projects to Slootman, he asks questions like: “Are you thrilled with this? Do you absolutely love it?” If people don’t respond with raging enthusiasm, he asks them to try again.   

人们通常知道自己的工作何时平庸。当人们向斯洛特曼展示项目时，他会问这样的问题：“你对此感到兴奋吗？你绝对喜欢它吗？”如果人们没有热情回应，他会要求他们再试一次。

Most managers set a low bar with murky expectations. Slootman sets a high bar with clear standards of success and failure.   

大多数管理者设定了较低的标准和模糊的期望。斯洛特曼设定了很高的标准，明确了成功和失败的标准。

Slootman’s compensation philosophy reflected his performance culture. All of his employees have a compensation review at the end of every quarter. Bonuses are divided into a pool, depending on how well the company performs. His managers aren’t allowed to pass out an equal share. He insists on a bell-shaped distribution curve to reflect the delta between high and low performers. The problem is that, at most companies, the A-players are under-paid. To pay your top performers more, you have to pay low-performing ones less. We’re going to adopt similar principles at Write of Passage.  

斯洛特曼的薪酬理念反映了他的绩效文化。他的所有员工在每个季度末都会进行薪酬审查。根据公司业绩的好坏，奖金被分成一个池。他的经理们不被允许分配同等的份额。他坚持采用钟形分布曲线来反映高绩效者和低绩效者之间的差异。问题在于，在大多数公司，一流员工的薪酬都偏低。为了向表现最好的员工支付更多的工资，你必须向表现不佳的员工支付更少的工资。我们将在《Write of Passage》中采用类似的原则。

At most companies, employees can receive bonuses without earning them. Bonuses are paid so predictably that people effectively see them as base pay. This, Slootman says, is the sure sign of an “Entitlement Culture.”    

在大多数公司，员工无需赚取奖金即可获得奖金。奖金的发放如此可预测，以至于人们实际上将其视为基本工资。斯洛特曼说，这是“权利文化”的明确标志。

Bonuses aren’t guaranteed because the company’s success isn’t either. Market forces are always shifting. Upstarts are trying to displace you. Competitors are gunning for your market share. If instability makes people uncomfortable, they belong at the California DMV, not at an Amp’d Up organization.  

奖金无法保证，因为公司的成功也无法保证。市场力量总是在变化。新贵们正试图取代你。竞争对手正在争夺您的市场份额。如果不稳定使人们感到不舒服，他们应该属于加州DMV，而不是Amp’d Up 组织。

### 3\. Narrow the Focus  

3\. 缩小焦点

You can’t increase the tempo and raise standards unless you also narrow the focus.   

除非你也缩小焦点，否则你无法加快节奏并提高标准。

This principle is the most misunderstood. If you don’t take it seriously, you’ll think Slootman is telling you to work so hard that you become a slave, which isn’t the case.   

这个原则是最容易被误解的。如果你不认真对待，你会认为斯洛特曼是在告诉你要努力工作，以至于成为奴隶，但事实并非如此。

Focus goes against our human nature. Most teams are scatter-brained. They refuse to commit and spread themselves thinly across too many priorities (many of which are ill-defined). Your job as a leader is to direct people to what’s ultimately important.   

专注违背了我们的人性。大多数团队都是心不在焉的。他们拒绝做出承诺，并将自己分散在太多的优先事项上（其中许多事项的定义不明确）。作为领导者，你的工作就是引导人们去做最重要的事情。

Narrow focus is also the result of clear thinking. It’s the leadership’s job to distill things down to their essentials. If leaders can’t communicate priorities at the top, how distorted will the thinking be for the rest of the team?   

狭窄的焦点也是清晰思维的结果。领导层的工作是将事情提炼到其本质。如果领导者无法在高层传达优先事项，那么团队其他成员的思维会有多大扭曲？

At Write of Passage, we say “projects are power laws.” The most important projects are orders of magnitude more important than average ones. It’s the job of leadership to identify pressure points in the company. To relieve tension in the body, massage therapists apply pressure to specific areas. When they find the spot, they don’t need much pressure to make a big impact.    

在《Write of Passage》中，我们说“项目就是幂律”。最重要的项目比一般项目重要几个数量级。领导层的工作就是识别公司的压力点。为了缓解身体的紧张，按摩治疗师会对特定区域施加压力。当他们找到合适的位置时，不需要太大的压力就能产生巨大的影响。

Murky thinking prevents prioritization. Just as knowing human anatomy helps a massage therapist find pressure points, you’ll only know what to prioritize if you know the anatomy of your company.   

模糊的思维阻碍了优先排序。正如了解人体解剖学可以帮助按摩治疗师找到压力点一样，只有了解公司的解剖结构，您才会知道要优先考虑什么。

Left to their own devices, people will work on easy and sexy (but incremental) problems. You can’t let this happen. You have to keep people focused on the levers that move the business the most.   

如果留给他们自己的设备，人们将致力于解决简单而性感（但渐进）的问题。你不能让这种事发生。您必须让人们专注于最能推动业务发展的杠杆。

Early on in the history of Write of Passage, we were guided by a quote from Jeff Weinstein at Stripe: “Solve problems 1 and 2, and let the other 98 burn.” There will always be too much to fix. Stripe co-founder John Collison once advised people to “be stuck more.” It’s good to ruminate on really hard problems. But if you’re averse to being stuck, you won’t persist through the pain that leads to an important breakthrough.   

在 Write of Passage 历史的早期，我们受到 Stripe 的杰夫·温斯坦 (Jeff Weinstein) 的一句话的指导：“解决问题 1 和 2，然后让其他 98 个问题消失。”总会有太多的事情需要解决。 Stripe 联合创始人约翰·科里森 (John Collison) 曾建议人们“多被困住”。反思真正困难的问题是件好事。但如果你不愿意被困住，你就不会在痛苦中坚持下去，从而取得重大突破。

People resist focus because they can’t decide what’s important. Prioritization scares them. They get Shiny Object Syndrome, where they flock to the hot new thing instead of doubling, tripling, and quadrupling down on what ultimately matters. Everybody’s scope will expand unless you constrain it with clear and concrete goals.  

人们抗拒集中注意力，因为他们无法决定什么是重要的。优先顺序让他们感到害怕。他们得了“闪亮物体综合症”，即他们涌向热门的新事物，而不是在最终重要的事情上加倍、三倍或四倍的努力。每个人的范围都会扩大，除非你用明确而具体的目标来限制它。

My friend Joe, the principal of Alpha School, says his three commitments over and over again because repetition is the twin sister of prioritization.[^4] If you can’t remember it, you can’t prioritize it. This is why nearly every successful entrepreneur masters the art of repetition. They’re memelords — they identify the most important variables for their company, codify them into principles, and relentlessly repeat them without ever losing chutzpah. The right mantras, said repeatedly, are mind-viruses. They change society by changing minds.  

我的朋友乔，阿尔法学校的校长，一遍又一遍地说出他的三项承诺，因为重复是优先顺序的孪生姐妹。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">4</a></sup> 如果你不记得它，你就无法优先考虑它。这就是为什么几乎每个成功的企业家都掌握了重复的艺术。他们是记忆大师——他们确定公司最重要的变量，将其编入原则，并不断地重复它们，但又不失肆无忌惮。人们一再强调，正确的咒语是心灵病毒。他们通过改变思想来改变社会。

Prioritize prioritization. Move faster by focusing more. A company isn’t focused enough unless it’s heartbroken about the projects it’s rejecting (this is good writing advice too).[^5]

优先排序。通过更加集中注意力，移动得更快。除非一家公司对其拒绝的项目感到心碎，否则它就不够专注（这也是很好的写作建议）。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">5</a></sup>  

The sharper the point of an object, the faster it can travel. The Concorde had the sharpest point of all and is the fastest commercial jetliner of all-time. Bullet trains are the same. Focus makes organizations fast by making them pointy. Every additional project creates drag. Yes, every single one.[^6]

物体的尖端越锋利，它的移动速度就越快。协和式飞机拥有所有飞机中最锋利的点，并且是有史以来速度最快的商用喷气式飞机。子弹头列车也是一样的。专注使组织变得尖锐，从而使组织变得更快。每增加一个项目都会产生阻力。是的，每一个。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">6</a></sup>

*Anything* that departs from your core mission is a distraction. Even the most well-intended projects have hidden costs. During early Q&As at Facebook, employees would ask Zuckerberg if the company could support nonprofits directly. [He always said no](https://boz.com/articles/focus). Supporting them wasn’t their comparative advantage. And besides, the nonprofits would all use Facebook once it became successful, which would help them in the long run.   

任何偏离你的核心使命的事情都会让你分心。即使是最善意的项目也有隐性成本。在 Facebook 的早期问答中，员工会问扎克伯格公司是否可以直接支持非营利组织。他总是说不。支持他们并不是他们的比较优势。此外，一旦Facebook成功，非营利组织都会使用它，从长远来看，这对他们有帮助。

Force people to answer questions like: If we could only commit to one thing for the rest of the year, what would it be?  

迫使人们回答这样的问题：如果我们在今年剩下的时间里只能承诺做一件事，那会是什么？

When I meet with multiple members of the same team, I like to ask: “What’s the team’s priority?” It takes two minutes. The more aligned the answers, the more focused the team (make sure to ask everybody separately though). If there’s too much variance among the answers, I know the team isn’t focused enough.  

当我与同一团队的多名成员见面时，我喜欢问：“团队的首要任务是什么？”需要两分钟。答案越一致，团队就越专注（但请确保分别询问每个人）。如果答案之间存在太大差异，我就知道团队不够专注。

## Slootman’s Ways of Working  

Slootman 的工作方式

Slootman’s philosophy is guided by a few more heuristics. Though he runs B2B companies, every principle I’ve selected below wholeheartedly applies to Write of Passage.   

斯洛特曼的哲学还受到一些启发式的指导。尽管他经营着 B2B 公司，但我在下面选择的每一条原则都完全适用于 Write of Passage。

They reflect our weaknesses as a company, such as our fear of confrontation, hesitation to let go of poor performers, and our tendency to take on too many projects at once. Following them will also help us build a culture of Radical Candor.  

它们反映了我们作为一家公司的弱点，比如我们害怕对抗、犹豫是否要解雇表现不佳的员工，以及我们倾向于同时承担太多项目。追随他们也将帮助我们建立一种激进坦率的文化。

### Leadership is Confrontation  

领导就是对抗

Slootman was once asked to talk about a confrontation that stands out. To which, he replied: “My whole life is confrontation.”   

斯洛特曼曾被要求谈论一次引人注目的对抗。对此，他回答说：“我的一生就是对抗。”

To be clear, a confrontation is not an argument or an attack. Confrontations are about facing the problem head-on. They should be calm and respectful, but direct. Each one should be done with High Care, High Empathy, and Low Emotion. Arguments are just the opposite. They’re born out of Low Care, Low Empathy, and High Emotion.   

需要明确的是，对抗不是争论或攻击。对抗就是直面问题。他们应该冷静、尊重，但要直接。每一件事情都应该以高度的关怀、高度的同理心和低度的情绪来完成。论点恰恰相反。他们的诞生源于低关心、低同理心和高情绪。

Leaders are always confronting people because a company can only Amp It Up if its leadership upholds the quality bar. Every meeting, every encounter, and every confrontation is a chance to step up the pace, raise expectations, demand excellence, and narrow the plane of attack. Investigate problems quickly. Run towards BS. Demand clarity when you sense confusion.   

领导者总是要面对人们，因为只有领导层坚持质量标准，公司才能实现发展。每一次会面、每一次遭遇、每一次对抗，都是一个加快步伐、提高期望、要求卓越、缩小攻击范围的机会。快速调查问题。奔向BS。当你感到困惑时，要求清晰。

Yes, it is confrontational — but confronting people and problems is part and parcel of effective leadership.   

是的，它是对抗性的——但直面人和问题是有效领导的重要组成部分。

### Work Sequentially 

按顺序工作

Less parallelization, more prioritization.   

更少的并行化，更多的优先级。

Companies usually widen their surface area of attack as they grow. They distract themselves by taking on too many projects at once. Taken in isolation, each one is seen as only a small addition with no opportunity costs. But collectively, the organization loses its focus, until employees feel like they’re swimming in glue.   

随着公司的发展，他们通常会扩大攻击范围。他们会因为同时承担太多项目而分散自己的注意力。单独来看，每一项都被视为只是一个很小的补充，没有机会成本。但总的来说，组织失去了焦点，直到员工感觉自己在胶水中游泳。

Working sequentially is one solution. Say you have ten projects you want to complete. One strategy is to start all of them at the same time. On the other end of the spectrum, you can work on one at a time, and move onto the next project only after you’ve finished the preceding one (which Slootman calls “working sequentially”).   

按顺序工作是一种解决方案。假设您有十个想要完成的项目。一种策略是同时启动所有这些。另一方面，您可以一次处理一个项目，只有在完成前一个项目后才能开始下一个项目（斯洛特曼称之为“顺序工作”）。

Doing so forces you to prioritize. By encouraging debate about what projects to pursue and the tradeoffs that’ll result from such decisions, it clarifies what’s important in the organization.  

这样做会迫使你确定优先顺序。通过鼓励讨论要开展哪些项目以及此类决策将产生的权衡，它澄清了组织中重要的事情。

### Operators Should Run Strategy  

运营商应运行策略

When we were hiring for a Chief Operations Officer, we spoke with one candidate who proudly called himself a strategist. He didn’t want to do any of the actual work. He wanted to talk and whiteboard instead. We decided not to hire him because we wanted more of a hands-on contributor. And boy, I’m glad that’s what we did.   

当我们招聘首席运营官时，我们采访了一位自豪地称自己为战略家的候选人。他不想做任何实际的工作。他想用谈话和白板来代替。我们决定不雇用他，因为我们想要更多的亲力亲为的贡献者。天哪，我很高兴我们就是这么做的。

Strategy is important, but you shouldn’t hire “strategists.” Operators should set the strategy instead. The problem is that operators and strategists have misaligned incentives. Slootman says that great operators live, breathe, and own their strategies.   

战略很重要，但你不应该雇佣“战略家”。运营商应该制定策略。问题在于运营商和战略家的激励措施不一致。斯洛特曼说，伟大的经营者生活、呼吸并拥有自己的策略。

Strategy begins at the top.[^7] The Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Strategy Officer too. Many companies employ people who do nothing but set strategy. They’re effectively in-house consultants with no operational responsibilities. When the going gets tough, some of them even delegate their strategy to suits at consulting firms who can tell them what to do.  

战略从高层开始。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">7</a></sup> 首席执行官也是首席战略官。许多公司雇佣的员工除了制定战略之外什么都不做。他们实际上是内部顾问，没有运营责任。当事情变得艰难时，他们中的一些人甚至将他们的策略委托给咨询公司的高管，他们可以告诉他们该怎么做。

### Hire Drivers, Not Passengers  

雇用司机，而不是乘客

Every company makes hiring mistakes. Most first-time founders fire poor performers too slowly. It’s not the C-players who kill your organization. Everybody knows they need to go. It’s the B-players who destroy it. They’re the mediocre ones who are good enough to keep around, but they’re lethargic. They slow organizations down by making them bulky.   

每个公司都会犯招聘错误。大多数首次创始人解雇表现不佳的员工的速度太慢。杀死你组织的不是 C 级人才。每个人都知道他们需要离开。是 B 级玩家毁掉了它。他们是平庸的人，足够优秀，可以留下来，但他们昏昏欲睡。它们使组织变得庞大，从而减慢组织的速度。

And the decline doesn’t just come from slowness. It comes from a failure to uphold the quality bar too. Standards fall. The work loses its magic. When commitment to excellence fades, the top performers look for other jobs.[^8]

下降不仅仅源于缓慢。这也源于未能坚持质量标准。标准下降。作品失去了魔力。当对卓越的承诺消失时，表现最好的人就会寻找其他工作。 <sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="aa5cdc84-c78b-4ead-9c4a-04e497777b14"><a href="https://writeofpassage.school/2023/02/10/amp-it-up/#footnotes">8</a></sup>

B-players are cockroaches. Like carbon monoxide, they unknowingly kill you while you’re asleep.   

B级选手都是蟑螂。就像一氧化碳一样，它们会在您熟睡时不知不觉地杀死您。

By keeping B-players, you’re repelling A-players. People resent slackers at work just as they resented slackers on group projects in school. High-performers want to work with people who are as talented and committed to the mission as they are. Being overly compassionate with under-performing employees in the short term leads to destruction in the long term.  

通过保留二流人才，你就排斥了一流人才。人们讨厌工作中的偷懒者，就像他们讨厌学校里的小组项目上的偷懒者一样。高绩效者希望与与他们一样有才华并致力于使命的人一起工作。短期内对表现不佳的员工过于同情会导致长期的破坏。

Slootman makes the distinction between drivers and passengers.  

斯洛特曼区分了司机和乘客。

Passengers are people who ride the company’s momentum without contributing to it. They’re absent and indifferent. They rarely take initiative or provide input. Since their survival strategy is to avoid trouble, they don’t push back against faulty logic. And they are dead weight.   

乘客是那些利用公司动力而不为其做出贡献的人。他们缺席且冷漠。他们很少采取主动或提供意见。由于他们的生存策略是避免麻烦，因此他们不会抵制错误的逻辑。而且它们很重。

Once you remove the passengers, the pace and energy increase. As somebody said to me recently, “I’ve never fired somebody and not had their replacement be better.”  

一旦乘客离开，速度和能量就会增加。正如有人最近对我说的那样，“我从来没有解雇过某人，也没有让他们的替代者变得更好。”

Hire drivers. They get satisfaction from making things happen, not from blending in. They increase the tempo, confront poor performance, are quick to stand up for the company when something’s not right, and feel a strong sense of ownership. This is why, at Write of Passage, we will forever reward clear and concrete feedback, especially when it’s delivered with care.  

雇用司机。他们从让事情发生而不是融入中获得满足感。他们加快节奏，面对糟糕的表现，在出现问题时迅速挺身而出，并感受到强烈的主人翁意识。这就是为什么在 Write of Passage 中，我们将永远奖励清晰而具体的反馈，尤其是当它被小心地提供时。

## **How the Amp It Up System Fits Together**  

**Amp It Up 系统如何组合在一起**

Slootman’s system is a triad. Each pillar amplifies the other ones. Slootman asks: “How much faster do you run? How much higher are your standards? How hard do you focus?”  

斯洛特曼的系统是一个三元组。每个支柱都会放大其他支柱。斯洛特曼问道：“你跑得快多少？你的标准高了多少？你有多努力集中注意力？”

Narrow focus is the hardest one to do. If you try to increase the tempo and raise standards without narrowing your focus, you’ll burn yourself out and ship sloppy work. Do way less, but do it faster and better.   

窄焦点是最难做到的。如果你试图加快节奏、提高标准而不缩小你的注意力，你就会精疲力尽，工作也会马虎。做得更少，但做得更快更好。

Don’t fully optimize for one variable at the expense of the others. Solely obsess over speed and you’ll compromise high standards. A lack of context, documentation, clear communication, and getting the right people involved can lead to things breaking and negative downstream effects. If you feel like speed and quality are in tension, you should probably narrow the focus.   

不要以牺牲其他变量为代价来完全优化一个变量。如果只关注速度，你就会牺牲高标准。缺乏背景、文档、清晰的沟通以及让合适的人员参与可能会导致事情破裂和负面的下游影响。如果您觉得速度和质量处于紧张状态，您可能应该缩小焦点。

On the topic of focus, I once heard a story about a billionaire who used to share a different message every time he spoke to his company. He employed smart people and thought they wanted novelty. That changed when one day, a trusted mentor looked him in the eye and said, “You’re doing it totally wrong. Pick a simple message and say it over and over again.”   

关于焦点这个话题，我曾经听过一个关于一位亿万富翁的故事，他每次与他的公司交谈时都会分享不同的信息。他雇佣了聪明的人，并认为他们想要新奇的东西。有一天，一位值得信赖的导师看着他的眼睛说：“你做的完全错了。选择一条简单的信息并一遍又一遍地说出来。”

His next all-hands talk was at the company holiday party. He was so nervous to repeat a simple message and potentially look like an idiot in front of the entire company that he got wasted before he went on stage. But once he got up there, he stuck to the plan. His message was simple enough to summarize in one sentence. People loved it. Since then, he hasn’t stopped repeating the same message over and over again. 25 years after the holiday party talk, he insists that a key to his success is sloganizing everything and repeating the same basic mantras.  

他的下一次全体会议是在公司假日聚会上。他非常紧张地重复一个简单的信息，并且可能在整个公司面前看起来像个白痴，以至于他在上台之前就已经喝醉了。但他一到那里，就坚持了计划。他的信息很简单，可以用一句话来概括。人们喜欢它。从那时起，他就没有停止过一遍又一遍地重复同样的信息。节日派对演讲 25 年后，他坚持认为，他成功的关键是口号化一切并重复相同的基本咒语。

Amp It Up is one of those mantras for us at Write of Passage. When you apply the Amp It Up philosophy, people radiate ambition, urgency, boldness, and Hearts on Fire. Increase the tempo, raise the standards, narrow the focus.  

Amp It Up 是 Write of Passage 的座右铭之一。当你运用“Amp It Up”理念时，人们会散发出雄心、紧迫感、大胆和热情。加快节奏，提高标准，缩小焦点。

When?” Rarely do they have compelling answers to these questions, which implies a lack of transcendent thinking.  在反对渐进主义的战争中，斯洛特曼喜欢问首席执行官们：“如果他们全力以赴，公司能增长多快？业务能否开始加速并在某个时候呈指数级增长？什么时候？”他们很少对这些问题给出令人信服的答案，这意味着他们缺乏超越性的思维。

No emotional attachment. The ability to change your mind is a surprisingly rare skill, and it’s one reason why he’s such a successful investor. Leaders must be able to change their minds too. You don’t get points for coming up with the solution. You get points for being right and building a successful business. It doesn’t matter who comes up with the idea. In business, as with investing, you’re going to get things wrong. It’s okay if you’re quick to recognize and correct your mistakes.  我曾经与一位非常成功的公共股票投资者进行过交谈。当一位朋友成功反驳了他的论点后，他立即改变了主意。没有骄傲。没有自我。没有情感依恋。改变主意的能力是一种罕见的技能，这也是他成为如此成功的投资者的原因之一。领导者也必须能够改变想法。你不会因提出解决方案而获得积分。您因正确并建立成功的企业而获得积分。谁想出这个主意并不重要。在商业中，就像投资一样，你可能会犯错。如果你能很快认识到并改正自己的错误，那也没关系。
