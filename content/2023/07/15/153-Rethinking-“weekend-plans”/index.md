On my latest advice podcast, my cohost Danny and I answered a question from someone about the tyranny of maintaining a social calendar. The questioner said that they have a “fairly normal social life,” just with one problem: they often find themselves feeling anxious about filling their weekend with fun plans. “In the past, I dealt with this anxiety by simply making a ton of plans,” they said, “which usually worked in the short-term but also made me feel like I was on a hamster wheel—going through the weekend, then immediately worrying about what the next one would look like and rushing to fill it again.” They wanted advice for getting off the wheel without, presumably, becoming a hermit or feeling friendless. I chose this question because I’ve asked it [several times](https://repeller.com/hang-out-reminders-and-social-insecurity/) myself.  

在我最新的建议播客中，我和我的搭档丹尼回答了某人关于维护社交日历的暴政的问题。提问者说，他们有“相当正常的社交生活”，只是有一个问题：他们经常发现自己对用有趣的计划来充实周末感到焦虑。 “过去，我只是通过制定大量计划来应对这种焦虑，”他们说，“这些计划通常在短期内有效，但也让我感觉自己就像在仓鼠轮上一样——度过周末，然后立即担心下一个会是什么样子，并急于再次填充它。”他们希望得到一些建议，以便摆脱方向盘，以免成为隐士或感到没有朋友。我选择这个问题是因为我自己已经问过好几次了。

Danny’s advice was practical: He suggested they experiment with spending a weekend entirely by themselves, not just to give their social battery time to refill, but to recast a fear (no plans) into a choice (no plans). My advice was for them to interrogate what they’re afraid having no plans might say about them. To ask themselves what specific feeling they’re running from, when it felt most potent growing up, and what tools they have now, as an adult, to soothe that fear instead of exhaustively catering to it. Basically inner-child stuff, and yes I used that term, I’m sorry! I stand by our advice. But the next day, I happened to come across an old journal of mine from high school, which I masochistically read, only to find an entry that had me suspecting there’s another, more systemic issue at hand when it comes to filling the modern weekend.   

丹尼的建议很实用：他建议他们尝试完全独自度过一个周末，不仅是为了让他们的社交电池有时间补充，而且是将恐惧（没有计划）重新转变为选择（没有计划）。我的建议是让他们质疑他们担心没有计划可能会说些什么。问问自己，他们在逃避什么具体的感觉，在成长过程中感觉最强烈的时候，以及作为一个成年人，他们现在有什么工具来缓解这种恐惧，而不是彻底迎合它。基本上是内心小孩的东西，是的，我用了这个词，我很抱歉！我坚持我们的建议。但第二天，我碰巧发现了我高中时写的一本旧日记，我受虐般地阅读了它，却发现其中的一个条目让我怀疑在填补现代周末时还有另一个更系统性的问题。

The entry was written on August 8th, 2006, during my summer vacation prior to my senior year of high school. I woke up that day at 10:30am, made breakfast, read in bed for three hours, made lunch, then checked MySpace and watched TV until 3:16pm—“and I have yet to see a living soul.” I then debated returning to bed to read, but instead decided to “make something of my afternoon,” and became delighted when I thought of an idea: to drive to a strip mall to deposit my $60-dollar Chili’s paycheck and withdraw some cash to pay my brother the $24 dollars I owed him. I went on and on about what I planned to wear (boxers and a Yankees hat) (lol), what I planned to bring (my family dog and a water bottle—“my new goal is to drink NONSTOP water every day”), and what my new account balance would be ($110 dollars, a number that thrilled 16-year-old me).  

这篇文章写于 2006 年 8 月 8 日，当时是我高三之前的暑假。那天我早上 10:30 起床，做了早餐，在床上看书三个小时，做了午餐，然后查看 MySpace，看电视直到下午 3:16——“但我还没有看到一个活着的灵魂。”然后，我犹豫着要不要回到床上看书，但最终决定“好好利用我的下午”，当我想到一个主意时，我很高兴：开车去一家露天购物中心存入我 60 美元的 Chili 工资，然后提取一些现金偿还我欠我兄弟的 24 美元。我不停地谈论我计划穿什么（平角裤和洋基队帽子）（笑），我计划带什么（我家的狗和一个水瓶——“我的新目标是每天不间断地喝水”），我的新账户余额是多少（110 美元，这个数字让 16 岁的我兴奋不已）。

The entry is comically dull, but my joy at this simple errand is palpable. Reading it, I was struck by the memory of how much time it took, even as recently as 2006, to do things that today are done immediately, automatically, or from our couches—like getting paid, or paying someone else. Obviously this becomes truer the further you go back in time, to a point that sounds genuinely tiresome (e.g. spending an entire day washing your pants). But there is a sweet spot, at least in my imagination, in which errands took up a good portion of my life without completely overtaking it. Today, meanwhile, my to-do list is infinitely longer than it’s ever been, and yet real, out-of-the-house errands—afternoon cleared, sneakers and sunglasses on: the kind of errands my mom seemed to be running during my childhood—are harder to come by. I think this is true for many in my cohort, and I think it’s fundamentally changed the makeup of our calendars, particularly our weekends.  

条目枯燥得可笑，但我对这个简单差事的喜悦是显而易见的。读完这本书后，我震惊地想起，即使是在 2006 年，我们还是需要花很多时间才能完成今天需要立即、自动或在沙发上完成的事情，比如领取报酬或向其他人付款。显然，你回溯得越远，这一点就越真实，甚至到了听起来确实令人厌烦的程度（例如，花一整天时间洗裤子）。但有一个甜蜜的时刻，至少在我的想象中，差事占据了我生活的很大一部分，但又没有完全取代它。与此同时，今天，我的待办事项清单比以往任何时候都长得多，但真正的外出差事——下午清理完毕，穿着运动鞋和太阳镜：我妈妈在我的时候似乎正在做的那种差事。童年——更难获得。我认为这对我的许多人来说都是如此，而且我认为这从根本上改变了我们日历的构成，尤其是我们的周末。

If we associate leaving the house only with seeing friends, seeking pleasure, or simply getting out for the love of god, it follows that going out is something we only do voluntarily, rather than for the general business of staying on top of things. Under this purview, “having weekend plans” means having *fun* plans. While staying home—whether to work, take care of business, or relax—is “not plans.” And that distinction feels correct. Sure, we could argue that sitting on our computers or puttering around our houses should count as plans, but neither connotes the life-giving kineticism of executing a plan outside, with friends, or in public, and I don’t think we should pretend it does. Regardless, this is a distinctly modern mode of operation.  

如果我们将离开家仅仅与见朋友、寻求快乐或仅仅出于对上帝的爱而外出联系起来，那么外出只是我们自愿做的事情，而不是为了掌控一切的一般事务。在此范围内，“有周末计划”意味着有有趣的计划。而待在家里——无论是工作、处理事务还是放松——都“不是计划”。这种区别感觉是正确的。当然，我们可以说，坐在电脑前或在家里闲逛应该算作计划，但这两者都不意味着在外面、与朋友或在公共场合执行计划的赋予生命的动力，而且我认为我们不应该假装确实如此。无论如何，这是一种明显现代的运作模式。

In this [recent](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/06/life-before-cell-phones-internet-after-work.html) *[Slate](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/06/life-before-cell-phones-internet-after-work.html)* [story](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/06/life-before-cell-phones-internet-after-work.html) about life before cell phones, a group of Gen-Xers describe their experience of being 27-ish around 2002. Their accounts are filled with what today we’d consider inconvenience: the inability to make plans on the fly, driving to people’s houses to see what they were doing, calling a number to check movie times and making a separate trip to the theater to buy tickets, organizing one’s calendar around a TV show that was on at a specific hour, going to actual stores to buy things, the inability to respectfully flake, the need for “common hangout spots” in case the person you were supposed to meet didn’t show up. The tone of their recollections is a little mystified—how could they have lived like that?—and yet their excitement in remembering is palpable. Some of that’s probably just nostalgia, but the details speak for themselves: The simple things they’re describing required a genuine spirit of adventure.  

在最近的 Slate 故事中，讲述了手机出现之前的生活，一群 X 一代描述了他们在 2002 年左右 27 岁左右的经历。他们的账户充满了我们今天认为的不便：无法即时制定计划，开车去人们家看看他们在做什么，拨打电话号码查看电影放映时间并单独前往剧院购买门票，围绕特定时间播放的电视节目安排日历，前往实际商店购买电影票买东西、无法礼貌地离开、需要“共同的聚会地点”以防你应该见到的人没有出现。他们回忆的语气有点神秘——他们怎么会那样生活？——但他们回忆时的兴奋是显而易见的。其中一些可能只是怀旧，但细节不言而喻：他们所描述的简单事物需要真正的冒险精神。

In 2006, depositing money and paying my brother back took an afternoon. It pulled me out of the house, got me dressed, felt like “plans,” made me feel like I’d accomplished something. Today, doing those things would take me 30 seconds (the Venmo, I mean; getting paid takes no time at all), and I could do it in my pajamas, leaving the rest of my afternoon open like a wound I needed to dress with something else, and quickly. That something else could be more digital chores (requires focus), something social (requires planning), or something mind-numbing to blot out both options (screentime). This is one effect of convenience culture: We can get things done so easily and predictably now that we have time to do more things in a day than we used to. But what are those things exactly?  

2006年，存钱、还钱给弟弟花了一个下午的时间。它把我从房子里拉出来，让我穿好衣服，感觉就像“计划”，让我觉得我已经完成了一些事情。今天，做这些事情需要我 30 秒（Venmo，我的意思是；获得报酬根本不需要时间），而且我可以穿着睡衣做这件事，让我下午剩下的时间像伤口一样敞开着，我需要包扎别的事情，而且要快。其他的事情可能是更多的数字杂务（需要专注），一些社交活动（需要计划），或者一些令人头脑麻木的东西，以消除这两种选择（屏幕时间）。这是便利文化的影响之一：我们现在可以轻松且可预测地完成工作，因为我们每天有时间比以前做更多的事情。但这些东西到底是什么？

In *Four Thousand Weeks,* a philosophical book about time management by Oliver Burkeman, he explains something he calls “the efficiency trap,” whereby the more we do, the more there is to do. This is of course counter to the mythology of productivity, which tells us that the sooner we can get things done, the sooner we’ll be able to relax and enjoy ourselves. Instead, Burkeman argues that “what needs doing” simply “expands to fill the time available.” Become efficient at work and you’ll be given more work. Answer all your emails and you’ll get all the replies and more. Finally reach your goals and you’ll think of new ones. There’s not actually an end in sight, and so by placing our faith in ever-decreasing segments of time spent on individual to-dos, we simply create the opportunity to complete more errands in less time, and in a more boring way. This reality presents us with the following paradox: Because it now takes less time to do things, we have way too much to do.  

在奥利弗·伯克曼（Oliver Burkeman）所著的关于时间管理的哲学著作《四千周》中，他解释了他所谓的“效率陷阱”，即我们做得越多，要做的事情就越多。这当然与生产力的神话相反，生产力的神话告诉我们，我们越早完成事情，我们就能越早放松并享受自己。相反，伯克曼认为“需要做的事情”只是“扩展以填补可用的时间”。提高工作效率，你就会得到更多的工作。回复所有电子邮件，您将收到所有回复以及更多信息。最终实现你的目标，你会想到新的目标。实际上并没有结束的迹象，因此，通过相信花在个人待办事项上的时间会不断减少，我们只是创造了在更短的时间内以更无聊的方式完成更多任务的机会。这一现实给我们带来了以下悖论：因为现在做事所需的时间更少，所以我们有太多的事情要做。

All of this brings us to the state of the weekend in 2023. I suspect that this modern bifurcation between getting things done (often executed at home) or having fun (mediated through plans), has placed an immense amount of pressure on our social lives to get us out, about, and participating in the world. Because we’re able to pack so much productivity and nimble planning into any given weekend, the possibilities feel endless, and the prospect of “making the most of it” is overwhelming. But what if this doesn’t really jive with the human sensibility? What if we’re not energetically suited to doing so many things in so little time? As my friend Cat recently put it, “Having social plans should feel like a treat.” Which is to say, not a chore, and definitely not a hamster wheel.  

所有这一切都将我们带到了 2023 年周末的状态。我怀疑，完成工作（通常在家里执行）或享受乐趣（通过计划介导）之间的现代分歧给我们的社交生活带来了巨大的压力让我们走出去、了解世界并参与世界。因为我们能够在任何特定的周末都发挥如此多的生产力和灵活的计划，所以可能性感觉无穷无尽，“充分利用它”的前景是压倒性的。但如果这并不符合人类的情感呢？如果我们的精力不适合在这么短的时间内做这么多事情怎么办？正如我的朋友 Cat 最近所说，“制定社交计划应该感觉像是一种享受。”也就是说，这不是一件苦差事，也绝对不是仓鼠轮。

Slow errands, I’ve found, are a balm to this frazzled modern condition. Maybe this was a result of a post-lockdown romanticism, but I’ve come to realize that my favorite days aren’t the ones that are completely free and open to be filled with extracurriculars, but organized around getting quaint little things done outside of the house. Errands aren’t only a great way to “have plans” by yourself (Cat recently texted me that she spent an afternoon walking around the West Village getting copies of her keys made and taking some shoes to the cobbler, and was perfectly content), but they’re also the perfect texture for socializing. Cat and I have been making a concerted effort to organize our hangouts around doing errands—going somewhere to work, picking up a pair of glasses, dropping off a package—at an impossibly slow pace. This is just as pleasurable as standard-issue social plans, which tend to be expensive and require more creativity and forethought, but it can be a lot more intimate.  

我发现，缓慢的差事对于这种疲惫的现代状况来说是一剂良药。也许这是封锁后浪漫主义的结果，但我开始意识到，我最喜欢的日子并不是完全自由开放、充满课外活动的日子，而是围绕在外面做一些古怪的小事情来组织的。房子。出差不仅是自己“制定计划”的好方法（Cat 最近发短信给我，她花了一个下午在西村散步，复印了钥匙，还给鞋匠拿了一些鞋子，她非常满足），但它们也是社交的完美材质。凯特和我一直在齐心协力，围绕着办事来组织我们的聚会——去某个地方工作、拿起一副眼镜、投递包裹——以一种极其缓慢的速度。这与标准的社交计划一样令人愉快，后者往往价格昂贵，需要更多的创造力和深思熟虑，但它可以更加亲密。

Granted, this approach requires forethought of its own. I’d guess that many of you reading share my errand-romanticism, but fall out of it just as easily as I do. We’ve been trained so well by tech and advertising to think faster is better, and provided with so many tools to accommodate that value system, that resisting convenience takes constant re-commitment. But I find that the more I practice making real, genuine plans out of errands, thereby embracing their slowness, the less I dread them, and the less I dread making weekend plans. Meeting my brother at his tailor to help him decide how much to take in his pants becomes a perfect Saturday. Getting groceries and picking up a prescription with Avi becomes the perfect Sunday. Errands, whether we do them alone or with friends, are inherently social. By doggedly pursuing easier, faster ways to do them, we place an outsize burden on more “official” social outings, and lose something precious and lively in the process.  

诚然，这种方法本身需要深思熟虑。我猜想你们中的许多人都和我一样有浪漫主义的使命感，但也和我一样容易摆脱这种浪漫主义。我们接受了技术和广告的良好训练，认为思考得越快越好，并且提供了如此多的工具来适应这种价值体系，因此抵制便利性需要不断地重新承诺。但我发现，我越多练习从差事中制定真正的、真正的计划，从而接受它们的缓慢，我就越不害怕它们，我也就越不害怕制定周末计划。和我哥哥在裁缝店见面，帮助他决定裤子要穿多少，这就是一个完美的周六。使用 Avi 购买杂货和领取处方成为完美的周日。差事，无论我们独自做还是与朋友一起做，本质上都是社交性的。通过执着地追求更简单、更快捷的方式来实现这些目标，我们给更多的“正式”社交活动带来了巨大的负担，并在这个过程中失去了一些珍贵和活泼的东西。
