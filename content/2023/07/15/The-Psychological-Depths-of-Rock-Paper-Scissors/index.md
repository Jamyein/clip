Unless you have lived in a Skinner box from an early age, you know that the outcome of *tic-tac-toe* is utterly certain. At first glance, *rock-paper-scissors* appears almost as bad. A four-year-old might think there’s some strategy to it, but isn’t it basically random?  

除非你从小就生活在斯金纳盒子里，否则你就会知道井字游戏的结果是完全确定的。乍一看，石头剪刀布几乎同样糟糕。一个四岁的孩子可能会认为这是有策略的，但这基本上不是随机的吗？

Indeed, people often turn to *rock-paper-scissors* as a way of making random, arbitrary decisions — choosing who’ll buy the first round of drinks, say. Yet there is no quantum-uncertainty collapse, no tumble of a die, no random number generator here; both players make a choice. Surely this is wholly *non*random?  

事实上，人们常常把石头剪刀布作为做出随机、武断决定的一种方式——比如选择谁来购买第一轮饮料。然而，这里没有量子不确定性崩溃，没有骰子翻滚，也没有随机数生成器；双方玩家都做出选择。这肯定是完全非随机的吗？

This article is excerpted from Greg Costikyan’s book “[Uncertainty in Games](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262527538/uncertainty-in-games/)“  

本文摘自 Greg Costikyan 的著作《游戏中的不确定性》

All right, nonrandom it is, but perhaps it’s arbitrary? There’s no predictable or even statistically calculable way of figuring out what an opponent will do next, so that one choice is as good as another, and outcomes will be distributed randomly over time — one-third in victory for one player, one-third to the opponent, one-third in a tie. Yes?  

好吧，它是非随机的，但也许它是任意的？没有可预测的甚至是统计上可计算的方法来确定对手下一步会做什么，因此一种选择与另一种选择一样好，并且结果将随着时间的推移随机分布 - 一名球员获胜三分之一，另一名球员获胜三分之一对手，平局三分之一。是的？

Players quickly learn that this is a guessing game and that your goal is to build a mental model of your opponent, to try to predict his actions. Yet a naïve player, once having realized this, will often conclude that the game is still arbitrary; you get into a sort of infinite loop. If he thinks such-and-so, then I should do this-and-that; but, on the other hand, if he can predict that I will reason thusly, he will instead do the-other-thing, so my response should be something else; but if we go for a third loop — assuming he can reason through the two loops I just did — then . . . and so on, ad infinitum. So it is back to being a purely arbitrary game. No?  

玩家很快就会知道这是一个猜谜游戏，你的目标是建立对手的心理模型，尝试预测他的行动。然而，天真的玩家一旦意识到这一点，通常会得出这样的结论：游戏仍然是任意的；你陷入了一种无限循环。如果他这么想，那我就这样那样做；但是，另一方面，如果他能预测我会这样推理，他就会做相反的事情，所以我的反应应该是其他的；但如果我们进行第三个循环——假设他可以推理出我刚才做的两个循环——那么…… 。 。等等，无穷无尽。所以它又回到了纯粹的任意游戏。不？

No.

The reason *rock-paper-scissors* is not a purely arbitrary game, and the reason that an excellent player will win more often than chance would predict, is that human psychology is *not* random, and some behaviors are — not necessarily predictable, but likely to occur more often than chance would dictate.  

石头剪刀布不是纯粹任意的游戏，优秀玩家获胜的次数比机会预测的要多的原因是人类心理不是随机的，有些行为不一定是可预测的，但很可能是随机的。发生的频率比偶然性所规定的要高。

> A player who has studied the game will unquestionably win more than chance would dictate against a naïve player.

> 毫无疑问，研究过游戏的玩家会比新手玩家赢得更多的胜利。

One heuristic of experienced players is “Losers lead with Rock.” This is demonstrably true; naïve players will lead with Rock more often than one-third of the time. Your hand begins in the form of a rock, and it is easiest to keep it that way. The name of the game begins with “Rock,” and if you are mentally sorting through the options, it is the first one that will occur to you. And the word “rock” itself has connotations of strength and immovability. These factors lead players to choose Rock on their first go more often than chance would dictate. An experienced player can take advantage of this. Against a player you know to be naïve, you play Paper.  

经验丰富的玩家的一个启发是“失败者以摇滚为主导”。这显然是正确的；天真的玩家在三分之一以上的情况下会用摇滚来领先。你的手从石头的形状开始，保持这种状态是最容易的。游戏的名称以“Rock”开头，如果你在心里整理选项，它就是你第一个想到的选项。而“岩石”这个词本身就具有力量和不可移动的含义。这些因素导致玩家在第一次尝试时选择摇滚的次数比偶然性要多。有经验的玩家可以利用这一点。面对一个你知道很幼稚的玩家，你玩纸牌。

Similarly, players rarely choose the same symbol three times in a row, and almost never four times; it *feels* wrong to human psychology. An extended streak feels nonrandom and unlikely, even though in a purely random game, each new throw is stochastic, not dependent on the outcomes of previous throws. Thus in a truly random game, no matter how many times “Paper” has come up in a row before, there is a 1 in 3 chance of it coming up again. Given the nature of human psychology, if Paper has come up twice, there is far less than a 1 in 3 chance that the player will choose it again.  

同样，玩家很少会连续三次选择相同的符号，而且几乎不会选择四次；这对人类心理来说是错误的。即使在纯粹随机的游戏中，每次新的投掷都是随机的，不依赖于之前投掷的结果，但延长的连胜感觉是非随机的且不太可能。因此，在真正随机的游戏中，无论“Paper”之前连续出现过多少次，它再次出现的机会都是三分之一。考虑到人类心理的本质，如果 Paper 出现了两次，那么玩家再次选择它的机会远小于三分之一。

Even players who know this have to consciously try to overcome their bias against streaks — *particularly* if they lose with one gesture on the previous round. If you have played Paper twice in a row, and lost the last time you played, the human instinct is to try something different, and thus players will at that point choose Paper far less than one-third of the time.  

即使知道这一点的玩家也必须有意识地尝试克服他们对连胜的偏见——特别是如果他们在上一轮中因一个手势而输掉了。如果你连续玩过两次纸，最后一次输了，人类的本能就是尝试不同的东西，因此玩家此时选择纸的几率远低于三分之一。

In short, a player who has studied the game will unquestionably win more than chance would dictate against a naïve player, because he understands how human psychology is likely to affect the choices of his opponent. Of course, two players who both understand these factors are on a more even plane; but even here, there is the factor of human readability. It is hard to maintain a perfect “poker face,” and some are better at it than others. Some are better at noticing subtle cues in the expressions or body language of others. These skills are not always sufficient to *ensure* triumph, but they do produce a bias in favor of those more observant — and more socially adept at reading others.  

简而言之，一个研究过游戏的玩家毫无疑问会比一个天真的玩家赢得更多的机会，因为他了解人类心理可能如何影响对手的选择。当然，如果两个玩家都了解这些因素，那么他们的处境就会更加平衡。但即使在这里，也存在人类可读性的因素。保持完美的“扑克脸”很难，但有些人比其他人更擅长这一点。有些人更善于注意到他人表情或肢体语言中的微妙暗示。这些技能并不总是足以确保胜利，但它们确实产生了一种偏见，有利于那些更善于观察、更善于解读他人的社交能力的人。

In other words, at first glance *rock-paper-scissors* appears to be a guessing game, with victory going to the player who can outguess his opponent; at second glance, it appears to be purely arbitrary; and at third glance, the original supposition is justified. It *is*, in fact, a guessing game with victory going to the player who can outguess his opponent, but there are strategies to “outguessing.”  

换句话说，石头剪刀布乍一看是一个猜谜游戏，猜中对手的玩家获胜；反之亦然。乍一看，这似乎完全是任意的；乍一看，原来的假设是有道理的。事实上，这是一个猜谜游戏，谁能猜出对手就获胜，但“猜出”是有策略的。

Where is the uncertainty in *rock-paper-scissors*? That should be obvious. It is in the unpredictability of opposing players. In fact, that is *all there is* in *rock-paper-scissors*; a first-player shooter played in deathmatch mode may rely to some degree on player unpredictability, but it also relies on player performance. *Rock-paper-scissors* is a game of player unpredictability in its purest form, for this single factor is the sole determinant of the game’s uncertainty, its raison d’être, and its cultural continuance.  

石头剪刀布的不确定性在哪里？这应该是显而易见的。这是对手球员的不可预测性。事实上，这就是石头剪刀布的全部内容。在死亡竞赛模式下玩的第一人称射击游戏可能在某种程度上依赖于玩家的不可预测性，但它也依赖于玩家的表现。剪刀石头布是一款最纯粹的玩家不可预测性的游戏，因为这个单一因素是游戏的不确定性、其存在的理由和文化延续性的唯一决定因素。
