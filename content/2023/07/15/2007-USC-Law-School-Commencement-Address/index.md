## Background 背景

This speech was delivered as the commencement address to the graduates of the University of Southern California Law School on May 13, 2007.  
此演讲是 2007 年 5 月 13 日向南加州大学法学院毕业生的毕业典礼致辞。

## Speech Transcript 演讲稿

Well, no doubt many of you are wondering why the speaker is so old. Well, the answer is obviously he hasn’t died yet.  
毫无疑问，很多人都想知道为什么扬声器这么旧。好吧，答案显然是他还没有死。

And why was the speaker chosen? Well, I don’t know that either. I like to think that the development department had nothing to do with it. Whatever the reason I think it’s very fitting that I'm sitting here because I see one crowd of faces in the rear not wearing robes, and I know, from having educated an army of descendants, who really deserves a lot of the honors that are being given are the people here upfront. The sacrifice and the wisdom and the value transfer that comes from one generation to the next can never be underrated.  
为什么选择演讲者？嗯，我也不知道。我认为开发部门与此无关。不管出于什么原因，我认为我坐在这里是非常合适的，因为我看到后面一群人没有穿长袍，我知道，从教育了一支后裔大军中，他们真的应该得到很多荣誉。被给予的是这里的人。从一代人到下一代人的牺牲、智慧和价值转移永远不能被低估。

And that gives me enormous pleasure as I look at this sea of Asian faces to my left. All my life I’ve admired Confucius. I like the idea of filial piety, the idea that there are values that are taught and duties that come naturally and all that should be passed on to the next generation. And you people who don’t think there’s anything in this idea, please note how fast these Asian faces are rising in American life. I think they have something.  
当我看着左边这片亚洲面孔的海洋时，这给了我巨大的快乐。我一生都很崇拜孔子。我喜欢孝道的理念，即有一些可以被教导的价值观和自然而然的义务，而所有这些都应该传递给下一代。你们这些不认为这个想法有任何意义的人，请注意这些亚洲面孔在美国生活中崛起的速度有多快。我认为他们有一些东西。

All right, I scratched out a few notes and I’m going to try and just give an account of some ideas and attitudes that have worked well for me. I don’t claim that they are perfect for everybody. Although I think many of them are pretty close to universal values and many of them are can’t fail ideas.  
好吧，我写下了一些笔记，我将尝试记录一些对我来说很有效的想法和态度。我并不是说它们适合每个人。尽管我认为其中许多都非常接近普世价值观，而且其中许多都是不能失败的想法。

What are the core ideas that have helped me?  
对我有帮助的核心想法是什么？

Well, luckily, I got at a very early age the idea that the safest way to try and get what you want is to try and deserve what you want. It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule so to speak. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end. There is no ethos, in my opinion, that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have.  
幸运的是，我在很小的时候就意识到，尝试并得到你想要的东西的最安全的方法就是尝试并值得你想要的东西。这是一个非常简单的想法。可以说这是黄金法则。如果你在另一端，你想向世界交付你会购买的东西。在我看来，对于任何律师或任何其他人来说，没有什么比这更好的精神了。

By and large, the people who have this ethos win in life and they don’t win just money, just honors and emoluments. They win the respect, the deserved trust, of the people they deal with, and there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust. And so the way to get it is to deliver what you’d want to buy if the circumstances were reversed.  
总的来说，拥有这种精神的人在生活中获胜，他们赢得的不仅仅是金钱，还有荣誉和报酬。他们赢得了与他们打交道的人的尊重和应得的信任，并且从获得应得的信任中可以获得生活的巨大乐趣。因此，获得它的方法就是交付如果情况相反的话你想买的东西。

Occasionally, you find a perfect rogue of a person, who dies rich and widely known. But mostly, these people are fully understood by the surrounding civilization, and when the cathedral is full of people at the funeral ceremony, most of them are there to celebrate the fact that the person is dead.  
偶尔，你会发现一个完美的流氓，死时富有且广为人知。但大多数情况下，这些人完全被周围的文明所理解，当葬礼上大教堂里挤满了人时，他们中的大多数人都是在那里庆祝这个人已经去世的事实。

And that reminds me of the story of the time when one of these people died and the minister said, “It’s now time for someone to say something nice about the deceased.”  
这让我想起了其中一个人去世时的故事，部长说：“现在是时候有人为死者说几句好话了。”

And nobody came forward.  
没有人挺身而出。

And nobody came forward.  
没有人挺身而出。

And nobody came forward.  
没有人挺身而出。

And finally one man came up and he said, “Well, his brother was worse.”  
最后一个人走了过来，他说：“嗯，他的兄弟更糟。”

That is not where you want to go! That’s not the kind of funeral you want to have. You'll leave entirely the wrong example.  
那不是你想去的地方！这不是你想要的葬礼。你会留下完全错误的例子。

A second idea that I got very early was that there is no love that’s so right as admiration-based love, and that love should include the instructive dead. Somehow, I got that idea and I lived with it all my life and it’s been very very useful to me.  
我很早就得到的第二个想法是，没有一种爱比基于钦佩的爱更正确，而且爱应该包括有启发性的死者。不知何故，我有了这个想法，并且我一生都伴随着它，它对我来说非常非常有用。

A love like that celebrated by Somerset Maugham and his book “Of Human Bondage”… that’s a sick kind of love, it’s a disease. And if you find yourself in a disease like that my advice to you is turn around and fix it. Eliminate it.  
萨默塞特·毛姆及其著作《人类的束缚》所颂扬的那种爱……这是一种病态的爱，是一种疾病。如果你发现自己患有这样的疾病，我对你的建议是扭转并解决它。消除它。

Another idea that I got, and this may remind you of Confucius too, is that wisdom acquisition is a moral duty. It’s not something you do just to advance in life. Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty.  
我得到的另一个想法，这可能也会让你想起孔子，那就是获得智慧是一种道德义务。这不仅仅是为了生活的进步而做的事情。获得智慧是一种道德义务。

And there’s a corollary to that proposition which is very important. It means that you’re hooked for lifetime learning, and without lifetime learning you people are not going to do very well. You are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You’re going to advance in life by what you’re going to learn after you leave here.  
这个命题有一个非常重要的推论。这意味着你对终身学习着迷，如果没有终身学习，你的人就不会做得很好。仅凭你已经知道的知识，你在生活中不会走得太远。离开这里后，你将通过学到的东西在生活中取得进步。

If you take Berkshire Hathaway, which is certainly one of the best-regarded corporations in the world and may have the best long-term investment record in the entire history of civilization, the skill that got Berkshire through one decade would not have sufficed to get it through the next decade with the achievements made. Without Warren Buffett being a learning machine, a continuous learning machine, the record would have been absolutely impossible.  
如果你以伯克希尔哈撒韦为例，它无疑是世界上最受尊敬的公司之一，并且可能拥有整个文明史上最好的长期投资记录，那么帮助伯克希尔度过十年的技能还不足以获得它经历了下一个十年所取得的成就。如果沃伦·巴菲特不是一台学习机器，一台持续学习的机器，那么这个记录绝对是不可能的。

The same is true at lower walks of life. I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than when they got up and boy does that help—particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.  
下层社会也是如此。我经常看到那些在生活中崛起的人并不是最聪明的，有时甚至不是最勤奋的，但他们是学习机器。他们每天晚上睡觉时都比起床时更聪明，这很有帮助——尤其是当你还有很长的路要走时。

Alfred North Whitehead said it one time that “the rapid advance of civilization came only when man invented the method of invention” and, of course, he was referring to the huge growth of GDP per capita and all the other good things that we now take for granted, which started a few hundred years ago and before that all was stasis.  
阿尔弗雷德·诺斯·怀特海德曾经说过，“只有当人类发明了发明方法时，文明才得以迅速进步”，当然，他指的是人均国内生产总值的巨大增长以及我们现在所拥有的所有其他美好事物。这是理所当然的，这始于几百年前，在此之前一切都是停滞的。

So, if civilization can progress only when it invents the method of invention, you can progress only when you learn the method of learning.  
因此，如果文明只有发明发明方法才能进步，那么只有学会学习方法才能进步。

I was very lucky. I came to law school having learned the method of learning and nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning. And if you take Warren Buffett and watched him with a time clock, I would say half of all the time he spends is sitting on his ass and reading. And a big chunk of the rest of the time is spent talking one on one either on the telephone or personally with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him. In other words, it looks quite academic, all this worldly success.  
我很幸运。我来到法学院学习了学习方法，在我漫长的一生中，没有什么比持续学习更能帮助我了。如果你以沃伦·巴菲特为例，用打卡器观察他，我会说他一半的时间都坐在屁股上读书。剩下的大部分时间都花在了与他信任的、也信任他的才华横溢的人进行一对一的电话交谈或私下交谈上。换句话说，它看起来非常学术化，所有这些世俗的成功。

Academia has many wonderful values in it. I came across such a value not too long ago. It was several years ago, in my capacity as a hospital board chairman. I was dealing with a medical school academic. And this man over years of hard work had made himself know more about bone tumor pathology than almost anybody else in the world. And he wanted to pass this knowledge on to the rest of us.  
学术界有许多美好的价值观。不久前我发现了这样的价值。那是几年前，当时我担任医院董事会主席。我当时正在和一位医学院的学者打交道。经过多年的努力，这个人对骨肿瘤病理学的了解几乎比世界上任何人都多。他想将这些知识传递给我们其他人。

And how was he going to do it? Well, he decided to write a textbook that would be very useful to other people. And I don’t think a textbook like this sells two thousand copies if those two thousand copies are in all the major cancer centers in the world.  
他要怎么做呢？好吧，他决定写一本对其他人非常有用的教科书。如果世界上所有主要癌症中心都有这两千本，我认为这样的教科书不会卖出两千本。

He took a year sabbatical, he sat down in front of his computer and he had all the slides because he saved them and organized them and filed them. He worked 17 hours a day, 7 days a week, for a year and that was his sabbatical. At the end of the year, he had one of the great bone tumor pathology textbooks in the world. When you’re around values like that, you want to pick up as much as you can.  
他休了一年假，坐在电脑前，他拥有所有幻灯片，因为他保存了它们，整理并归档了它们。他每周工作 7 天，每天工作 17 小时，持续了一年，那是他的休假。年底，他拥有了世界上最伟大的骨肿瘤病理学教科书之一。当你拥有这样的价值观时，你会想要尽可能多地获得。

Another idea that was hugely useful to me was that I listened in law school when some wag said, “A legal mind is a mind that when two things are all twisted up together and interacting, it's feasible to think responsibly about one thing and not the other.”  
另一个对我非常有用的想法是，我在法学院听到一些爱开玩笑的人说：“法律思维是一种思维，当两件事都扭曲在一起并相互作用时，可以负责任地思考一件事而不是另一件事。其他。”

Well, I could see from that one sentence that was perfectly ridiculous, and it pushed me further into my natural drift, which was into learning all the big ideas and all the big disciplines so I wouldn’t be a perfect damn fool who was trying to think about one aspect of something that couldn’t be removed from the totality of the situation in a constructive fashion. And what I noted, since the really big ideas carry 95 percent of the freight, it wasn’t at all that hard for me to pick up all the big ideas and all the big disciplines and make them a standard part of my mental routines.  
好吧，我可以从这句话中看出这是非常荒谬的，它让我进一步进入了我的自然倾向，那就是学习所有伟大的想法和所有伟大的学科，这样我就不会成为一个正在尝试的完美傻瓜。以建设性的方式思考某件事中无法从整体情况中剔除的一个方面。我注意到，由于真正伟大的想法承担了 95% 的责任，所以对我来说，接受所有伟大的想法和所有重要的学科并使它们成为我的心理惯例的标准部分并不是那么困难。

Once you have the ideas, of course, they are no good if you don’t practice. You don’t practice, you lose it.  
当然，一旦有了想法，如果不去实践，那是没有用的。你不练习，你就会失去它。

So, I went through life constantly practicing this model of disciplinary approach. Well, I can’t tell you what that’s done for me. It’s made life more fun. It’s made me more constructive. It’s made me more helpful to others. It’s made me enormously rich. You name it, that attitude really helps.  
所以，我一生都在不断实践这种纪律方法的模式。好吧，我无法告诉你这对我做了什么。它让生活变得更加有趣。这让我变得更有建设性。这让我对别人更有帮助。它让我变得非常富有。你能想到的，这种态度真的很有帮助。

Now there are dangers there, because it works so well, that if you do it, you will frequently find you are sitting in the presence of some other expert—maybe even an expert that’s superior to you, supervising you—and you will know more than he does about his own specialty, a lot more. You will see the correct answer when he’s missed it.  
现在那里存在危险，因为它运作得很好，如果你这样做，你会经常发现你坐在其他一些专家面前——甚至可能是一个比你高级的专家，监督你——而且你会知道更多比他对自己的专业所做的要多得多。当他错过时你会看到正确的答案。

That is a very dangerous position to be in. You can cause enormous offense by helpfully being right in a way that causes somebody else to lose face. And I never found a perfect way to solve that problem. I was a great poker player when I was young, but I wasn’t a good enough poker player so people failed to sense that I thought I knew more than they did about their subjects, and it gave a lot of offense. Now I’m just regarded as eccentric, but it was a difficult period to go through. And my advice to you is to learn sometimes to keep your light under a bushel.  
这是一个非常危险的处境。如果你以某种方式帮助别人保持正确，却导致别人丢面子，那么你可能会造成巨大的冒犯。我从来没有找到解决这个问题的完美方法。我年轻时是一名出色的扑克玩家，但我还不是一名足够好的扑克玩家，所以人们没有意识到我认为我比他们更了解他们的主题，这引起了很大的冒犯。现在我只是被认为是个怪人，但那是一段艰难的时期。我给你的建议是，有时要学会保持低调。

One of my colleagues, also number one in his class in law school—a great success in life, worked for the supreme court, etc.—he knew a lot and he tended to show it as a very young lawyer and one day the senior partner called him in and said, “Listen, Chuck, I want to explain something to you. Your duty under any circumstances is to behave in such a way that the client thinks he’s the smartest person in the world. If you have any little energy and insight available after that, use it to make your senior partner look like the smartest person in the world. And only after you’ve satisfied those two obligations do you want your light to shine at all.”  
我的一位同事，在法学院的班上也是第一名——人生取得了巨大的成功，曾在最高法院工作过，等等——他知道很多，他倾向于以一名非常年轻的律师和有一天成为高年级律师的身份表现出来。合伙人把他叫进来，说道：“听着，查克，我想向你解释一件事。在任何情况下，你的职责都是让客户认为他是世界上最聪明的人。如果在那之后你还有一点点精力和洞察力，用它来让你的高级合伙人看起来像世界上最聪明的人。只有当你满足了这两项义务之后，你才会希望你的光芒闪耀。”

Well, that may be very good advice for rising in a large firm. It wasn’t what I did. I always obeyed the drift of my nature and if other people didn’t like it I didn’t need to be adored by everybody.  
嗯，对于在大公司晋升来说，这可能是一个非常好的建议。这不是我做的。我总是遵循我的本性，如果其他人不喜欢它，我不需要受到所有人的崇拜。

Another idea, and by the way, when I talk about this multidisciplinary attitude I’m really following a very key idea of the greatest lawyer of antiquity, Marcus Tullius Cicero. Cicero is famous for saying, “A man who doesn’t know what happened before he was born goes through life like a child.” That is a very correct idea of Cicero’s. And he’s right to ridicule somebody so foolish as not to know what happened before he was born.  
另一个想法，顺便说一句，当我谈论这种多学科态度时，我实际上遵循了古代最伟大的律师马库斯·图利乌斯·西塞罗的一个非常关键的想法。西塞罗有句名言：“一个不知道自己出生前发生过什么的人，一生就像个孩子。”这是西塞罗的一个非常正确的想法。他嘲笑一个愚蠢到不知道自己出生前发生了什么的人是正确的。

But if you generalize Cicero as I think one should, there are all these other things that you should know in addition to history, and those other things are the big ideas in all the other disciplines. And it doesn’t help you just to know them enough just so you can prattle them back on an exam and get an A. You have to learn these things in such a way that they’re in a mental latticework in your head and you automatically use them for the rest of your life.  
但是，如果你像我认为的那样概括西塞罗，那么除了历史之外，你还应该了解所有其他的事情，而这些其他的事情是所有其他学科的重要思想。仅仅为了在考试中喋喋不休并获得 A 而仅仅了解它们并不能帮助你。你必须以这样的方式学习这些东西，让它们在你的头脑中形成一个心理网格，并且你自动地在你的余生中使用它们。

If you do that, I solemnly promise you that one day you’ll be walking down the street and look to your right and left and think, “My heavenly days! I’m now one of the few most competent people of my whole age forward.” If you don’t do it, many of the brightest of you will live in the middle ranks or in the shallows.  
如果你这样做了，我郑重向你保证，有一天你会走在街上，左右看看，然后想：“我的天堂！我现在是整个年龄段中为数不多的最有能力的前锋之一。”如果你不这样做，你们中的许多最聪明的人将生活在中层或浅层。

Another idea that I got—and it was encapsulated by that story the Dean recounted about the man who wanted to know where he was going to die and he wouldn’t go there—that rustic let that idea have a profound truth in his hand.  
我得到的另一个想法——院长讲述的那个故事概括了这个想法，那个人想知道自己会死在哪里，但他不会去那里——那个质朴的人让这个想法掌握了深刻的真理。

The way complex adaptive systems work and the way mental constructs work; problems frequently get easier and I would even say usually are easier to solve if you turn around in reverse. In other words, if you want to help India, the question you should ask is not, “How can I help India?” You think, “What’s doing the worst damage in India? What would automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?”  
复杂适应性系统的工作方式和心理结构的工作方式；问题常常会变得更容易，我什至会说，如果你反过来，通常会更容易解决。换句话说，如果你想帮助印度，你应该问的问题不是“我怎样才能帮助印度？”你会想：“什么对印度造成了最严重的损害？什么会自动造成最严重的损害，我该如何避免呢？”

You’d think they are logically the same thing, they’re not. Those of you who have mastered algebra know that inversion frequently will solve problems which nothing else will solve. And in life, unless you’re more gifted than Einstein, inversion will help you solve problems that you can't solve in other ways.  
你可能会认为它们在逻辑上是同一件事，但事实并非如此。那些精通代数的人都知道，反转经常可以解决其他方法无法解决的问题。在生活中，除非你比爱因斯坦更有天赋，否则逆演将帮助你解决用其他方法无法解决的问题。

But to use a little inversion now, “What will really fail in life? What do you want to avoid?”  
但现在换个角度来说，“生活中真正会失败的是什么？你想避免什么？”

Such an easy answer: sloth and unreliability. If you’re unreliable, it doesn’t matter what your virtues are, you’re going to crater immediately. So doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.  
答案很简单：懒惰和不可靠。如果你不可靠，无论你有什么美德，你都会立即陷入困境。因此，做你忠实致力于做的事情应该成为你行为的一个自然组成部分。你要避免懒惰和不可靠。

Another thing I think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one’s mind. You’ve seen that. You see a lot of it on TV. You know preachers, for instance, you know they’ve all got different ideas about theology and a lot of them have minds that are made of cabbage. But that can happen with political ideology. And if you're young, it’s easy to drift into loyalties. And when you announce that you’re a loyal member and you start shouting the orthodox ideology out, what you’re doing is pounding it in, pounding it in, and you’re gradually ruining your mind so you want to be very careful with this ideology. It’s a big danger.  
我认为应该避免的另一件事是极端强烈的意识形态，因为它会让人头脑发热。你已经看到了。你在电视上看到很多这样的事情。例如，你知道传教士，你知道他们对神学都有不同的想法，而且他们中的很多人都有白菜做的头脑。但这可能会发生在政治意识形态上。如果你还年轻，很容易变得忠诚。当你宣布你是一个忠诚的成员，你开始大声喊出正统的意识形态时，你所做的就是把它敲进去，敲进去，你正在逐渐毁掉你的思想，所以你要非常小心这种意识形态。这是一个很大的危险。

In my mind, I got a little example I use whenever I think about ideology and it’s these Scandinavian canoeists who succeeded in taming all the rapids of Scandinavia and they thought they would tackle the whirlpools in the Aaron Rapids here in the United States. The death rate was 100 percent. A big whirlpool is not something you want to go into and I think the same is true about a really deep ideology.  
在我的脑海中，每当我思考意识形态时，我都会使用一个小例子，这些斯堪的纳维亚独木舟运动员成功地驯服了斯堪的纳维亚半岛的所有急流，他们认为他们可以解决美国亚伦急流的漩涡。死亡率是100%。大漩涡不是你想陷入的事情，我认为对于真正深刻的意识形态也是如此。

I have what I call an “iron prescription” that helps me keep sane when I naturally drift toward preferring one ideology over another. And that is I say, “I’m not entitled to have an opinion on this subject unless I can state the arguments *against* my position better than the people do who are supporting it.” I think only when I reach that stage am I qualified to speak.  
我有一个所谓的“铁方”，当我自然地倾向于一种意识形态而不是另一种意识形态时，它可以帮助我保持理智。我说的是，“我无权就这个问题发表意见，除非我能比支持我立场的人更好地阐述反对我立场的论点。”我想只有到了那个阶段我才有资格说话。

Now, you can say that’s too much of an iron discipline. It’s not too much of an iron discipline. It’s not even that hard to do. It sounds a lot like the iron prescription of Ferdinand the Great, “It’s not necessary to hope in order to persevere.” That probably is too tough for most people. I don’t think it’s too tough for me, but it's too tough for most people.  
现在，你可以说这太铁了。这并不是什么铁的纪律。这并不难做到。这听起来很像斐迪南大帝的铁律：“没有必要为了坚持而抱有希望。”对于大多数人来说这可能太难了。我不认为这对我来说太难了，但对大多数人来说太难了。

But this business of not drifting into extreme ideology is a very very important thing in life if you want to have more correct knowledge and be wiser than other people. A heavy ideology is very likely to do you in.  
但是，如果你想拥有更正确的知识并比其他人更聪明，那么不陷入极端意识形态是生活中非常非常重要的事情。沉重的意识形态很可能会让你陷入困境。

Another thing, of course, that does one in is the self-serving bias to which we are all subject. You think that your little me is entitled to do what it wants to do and, for instance, why shouldn’t the true little me overspend my income?  
当然，另一件事是我们所有人都受到的自私偏见的影响。你认为你的小我有权做它想做的事，例如，为什么真正的小我不应该超支我的收入？

Well, there once was a man who became the most famous composer in the world, but he was utterly miserable most of the time and one of the reasons was he always overspent his income. That was Mozart. If Mozart can’t get by with this kind of asinine conduct, I don’t think you should try it.  
嗯，曾经有一个人成为了世界上最著名的作曲家，但他大部分时间都过得很痛苦，原因之一就是他总是超支收入。那是莫扎特。如果莫扎特无法忍受这种愚蠢的行为，我认为你不应该尝试。

Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge, and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity.  
一般来说，嫉妒、怨恨、报复和自怜都是灾难性的思维方式。自怜与偏执非常接近，而偏执是最难扭转的事情之一。你不想陷入自怜之中。

I have a friend who carried a big stack of linen cards about this thick, and when somebody would make a comment that reflected self-pity, he would take out one of the cards, take the top one off the stack and hand it to the person, and the card said, “Your story has touched my heart. Never have I heard of anyone with as many misfortunes as you.”  
我有一个朋友，他手里拿着一大叠这么厚的亚麻卡片，当有人发表一些自怜的评论时，他会拿出其中一张卡片，从一叠卡片上取下最上面的一张，然后把它交给人，卡片上写着：“你的故事触动了我的心。我从来没有听说过有谁像你一样遭遇如此多的不幸。”

Well, you can say that’s waggery, but I suggest that every time you find you’re drifting into self-pity—I don’t care what the cause, your child could be dying of cancer, self-pity is not going to improve the situation—just give yourself one of those cards. It’s a ridiculous way to behave and when you avoid it you get a great advantage over everybody else, almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard condition and yet you can train yourself out of it.  
好吧，你可以说这是开玩笑，但我建议每次你发现自己陷入自怜时——我不在乎原因是什么，你的孩子可能会死于癌症，自怜不会改善情况——给自己一张这样的牌。这是一种荒谬的行为方式，当你避免这种行为时，你就会比其他人（几乎其他人）获得更大的优势，因为自怜是一种标准状况，但你可以训练自己摆脱它。

And, of course, a self-serving bias, you want to get out of yourself: thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self. It’s a terribly inaccurate way to think and, of course, you want to drive that out of yourself because you want to be wise, not foolish.  
当然，你想要摆脱自己的自私偏见：认为对你有利的事情也对更广泛的文明有利，并根据潜意识为自己服务的倾向合理化所有这些荒谬的结论。这是一种非常不准确的思维方式，当然，你想把这种想法从自己身上赶走，因为你想成为明智的人，而不是愚蠢的人。

You also have to allow for the self-serving bias of everybody else, because most people are not gonna remove it all that successfully, the only condition being what it is. If you don’t allow for self-serving bias in your conduct, again, you’re a fool.  
你还必须考虑到其他人的自私偏见，因为大多数人不会成功地消除它，唯一的条件就是它是什么。如果你不允许自己的行为中存在自私偏见，那么你就是个傻瓜。

I watched the brilliant Harvard Law Review-trained general counsel of Salomon lose his career. And what he did was, when the CEO was aware some underling had done something wrong, the general counsel said, “Gee, we don’t have any legal duty to report this, but I think it’s what we should do. It’s our moral duty.”  
我目睹了所罗门公司杰出的《哈佛法律评论》培训总法律顾问失去了他的职业生涯。他所做的是，当首席执行官意识到某些下属做了错事时，总法律顾问说：“哎呀，我们没有任何法律义务报告此事，但我认为这是我们应该做的。这是我们的道德义务。”

Of course, the general counsel was totally correct, but, of course, it didn’t work. It was a very unpleasant thing for the CEO to do and he put it off and put it off and, of course, everything eroded into a major scandal and down went the CEO and the general counsel with him.  
当然，总法律顾问是完全正确的，但是，当然，这是行不通的。对于首席执行官来说，这是一件非常不愉快的事情，他一拖再拖，当然，一切都演变成一场重大丑闻，首席执行官和总法律顾问也随之下台。

The correct answer in situations like that was given by Ben Franklin. He said, “If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason.” The self-serving bias is so extreme. If the general counsel said, “Look, this is going to erupt. It’s something that will destroy you, take away your money, take away your status. It’s a perfect disaster.” It would have worked! You want to appeal to interest. You want to do it of lofty motives, but you should not avoid appealing to interest.  
在这种情况下，本·富兰克林给出了正确的答案。他说：“如果你想说服别人，就诉诸利益，而不是讲道理。”自私的偏见是如此极端。如果总法律顾问说：“看，这件事将会爆发。它会摧毁你，夺走你的金钱，夺走你的地位。这是一场完美的灾难。”它会起作用的！你想引起兴趣。你想这样做是出于崇高的动机，但你不应该避免诉诸利益。

Another thing: perverse incentives. You don’t want to be in a perverse incentive system that’s causing you to behave more and more foolishly or worse and worse. Incentives are too powerful a controller of human cognition and human behavior, and one of the things you are going to find in some modern law firms is billable hour quotas and I could not have lived under a billable hour quota of 2,400 hours a year. That would have caused serious problems for me. I wouldn’t have done it and I don’t have a solution for you for that. You have to figure it out for yourself, but it’s a significant problem.  
另一件事：不正当的激励措施。你不想处于一个不正当的激励体系中，这会导致你的行为越来越愚蠢或者越来越糟糕。激励对于人类认知和人类行为的控制力太强大了，在一些现代律师事务所中你会发现的一件事就是计费小时配额，而我不可能生活在每年 2,400 小时的计费小时配额之下。这会给我带来严重的问题。我不会这么做，而且我也没有办法为你提供解决方案。你必须自己解决这个问题，但这是一个重大问题。

And you particularly want to avoid working directly under somebody you really don't admire and don't want to be like. It's very dangerous. We're all subject to control to some extent by authority figures—particularly authority figures that are rewarding us. And that requires some talent.  
而且你特别希望避免直接在你不欣赏并且不想成为的人的领导下工作。这是非常危险的。我们都在某种程度上受到权威人物的控制——尤其是那些奖励我们的权威人物。这需要一些天赋。

The way I solved that is I figured out the people I did admire and I maneuvered cleverly, without criticizing anybody, so I was working entirely under people I admired. And a lot of law firms will permit that if you're shrewd enough to work it out. And your outcome in life will be way more satisfactory and way better if you work under people you really admire. The alternative is not a good idea.  
我解决这个问题的方法是，我找出了我所敬佩的人，并巧妙地进行了操作，没有批评任何人，所以我完全在我敬佩的人的领导下工作。如果你足够精明，很多律师事务所都会允许你这样做。如果你在你真正钦佩的人手下工作，你的生活将会更加令人满意、更加美好。另一种选择并不是一个好主意。

Objectivity maintenance. Well, we all remember that Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly to disconfirm something he believed and loved. Well, objectivity maintenance routines are totally required in life if you’re going to be a correct thinker. And they were talking about Darwin’s attitude—special attention to the disconfirming evidence—and also to checklist routines. Checklist routines avoid a lot of errors. You should have all this elementary wisdom and then you should go through and have a checklist in order to use it. There is no other procedure that will work as well.  
客观性维护。好吧，我们都记得达尔文特别注重反驳证据，特别是反驳他相信和喜爱的东西。好吧，如果你想成为一个正确的思考者，那么生活中完全需要保持客观性。他们谈论的是达尔文的态度——特别关注反驳证据——以及检查清单惯例。检查表例程可以避免很多错误。你应该掌握所有这些基本智慧，然后你应该仔细检查并制定一份清单以便使用它。没有其他程序可以同样有效。

A last idea that I found very important is I realized very early that non-egality would work better in the parts of the world I wanted to inhabit. What do I mean by non-egality? I mean John Wooden, when he was the number one basketball coach in the world. He just said to the bottom five players, “You don't get to play. You're sparring partners.”  
我发现非常重要的最后一个想法是，我很早就意识到，非平等在我想居住的世界各地会更好。我所说的非平等是什么意思？我指的是约翰·伍登，当时他是世界第一的篮球教练。他只是对排名垫底的五名球员说：“你们不能参加比赛。你们是陪练伙伴。”

The top seven did all the playing. Well, the top seven learned more—remember the learning machine—because they were doing all the playing. And when he got to that system, why, Wooden won more than he'd ever won before.  
前七名完成了所有比赛。好吧，前七名学到了更多——记住学习机——因为他们在玩所有的游戏。当他进入这个系统时，为什么，伍登赢得了比他以前赢得的更多的胜利。

I think the game of life, in many respects, is getting a lot of practice into the hands of the people that have the most aptitude to learn and the most tendency to be learning machines. And if you want the very highest reaches of human civilization, that’s where you have to go. You do not want to choose a brain surgeon for your child among fifty applicants, all of them just take turns during the procedure. You don’t want your airplanes designed that way. You don’t want your Berkshire Hathaway’s run that way. You want to get the power into the right people.  
我认为，从很多方面来说，人生的游戏就是让那些最有学习能力、最有可能成为学习机器的人进行大量的练习。如果你想要达到人类文明的最高境界，那就是你必须去的地方。您不会想在五十个申请者中为您的孩子选择一名脑外科医生，他们只是轮流进行手术。你不希望你的飞机那样设计。你不希望你的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司以这种方式运作。您希望将权力交给合适的人。

I frequently tell the story of Max Planck, when he won the Nobel prize and went around Germany giving lectures on quantum mechanics. And the chauffeur gradually memorized the lecture and he said, “Would you mind, professor Planck, just because it's so boring staying in our routines, would you mind if I gave the lecture this time and you just sat in front with my chauffeur's hat?” And Planck said, “Sure.”  
我经常讲马克斯·普朗克的故事，当时他获得了诺贝尔奖，并在德国各地讲授量子力学。司机渐渐地记住了讲座内容，他说：“普朗克教授，你介意吗？就因为我们的日常生活太无聊了，你介意我这次演讲，而你只是坐在我前面，戴着我司机的帽子吗？” ”普朗克说：“当然。”

And the chauffeur got up and he gave this long lecture on quantum mechanics, after which a physics professor stood up in the rear and asked a perfectly ghastly question. And the chauffeur said, “Well, I'm surprised that in an advanced city like Munich I get such an elementary question. I'm going to ask my chauffeur to reply.”  
司机站起来，做了关于量子力学的长篇演讲，之后一位物理学教授站在后面，问了一个非常可怕的问题。司机说：“嗯，我很惊讶在慕尼黑这样的先进城市我会遇到如此基本的问题。我要请我的司机回复。”

Well, the reason I tell that story is not entirely to celebrate the quick wittiness of the protagonist. In this world, we have two kinds of knowledge. One is Planck knowledge—the people who really know. They've paid the dues, they have the aptitude.  
嗯，我讲这个故事的原因并不完全是为了庆祝主角的机智。在这个世界上，我们有两种知识。一是普朗克知识——真正了解的人。他们已经付出了代价，他们有能力。

Then, we've got chauffeur knowledge—they have learned to prattle the talk and they have a big head of hair. They may have fine timbre in the voice. They really make a hell of an impression. But in the end, they've got chauffeur knowledge. I think I've just described practically every politician in the United States.  
然后，我们有了司机知识——他们学会了喋喋不休，而且他们有一头大头发。他们的声音可能音质很好。他们确实给人留下了深刻的印象。但最终，他们掌握了司机知识。我想我刚刚描述了美国几乎每一位政客。

And you are going to have the problem in your life of getting the responsibility to the people with the Planck knowledge and away for the people who have the chauffeur knowledge. And there are huge forces working against you.  
你的生活中将会遇到这样的问题：把责任交给那些拥有普朗克知识的人，而把责任交给那些拥有司机知识的人。还有巨大的力量对你不利。

My generation has failed you to some extent. We are delivering to you, in California, a legislature where only the certified nuts from the left and the certified nuts from the right are allowed to serve and none of them are removable. That’s what my generation has done for you, but you wouldn’t like it to be too easy would you?  
我这一代人在某种程度上让你们失望了。我们在加利福尼亚州向您提供一个立法机构，其中只有左侧经过认证的坚果和右侧经过认证的坚果才可以食用，而且它们都不可拆卸。这就是我这一代人为你们所做的，但你们不会希望这太容易吧？

Another thing that I found is an intense interest of the subject is indispensable if you are really going to excel. I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn’t be really good in anything where I didn’t have an intense interest. So, to some extent, you’re going to have to follow me. If at all feasible you want to drift into doing something in which you really have a natural interest.  
我发现的另一件事是，如果你真的想取得优异的成绩，对这个学科的浓厚兴趣是必不可少的。我可以强迫自己在很多事情上做得相当好，但在我没有强烈兴趣的事情上我无法真正做好。所以，在某种程度上，你必须跟随我。如果可行的话，你想尝试做一些你真正感兴趣的事情。

Another thing you have to do, of course, is have a lot of assiduity. I like that word because it means “sit down in your ass until you do it.”  
当然，你必须做的另一件事就是勤奋。我喜欢这个词，因为它的意思是“坐下来直到你做到这一点”。

I’ve had marvelous partners all my life. I think I got them partly because I tried to deserve them and, partly, because I was wise enough to select them and, partly, maybe it was some luck. But two partners that I chose for one little phase of my life had the following rule and they created a little design-build construction team. And they sat down and said, “Two-man partnership. Divide everything equally. Here’s the rule: Whenever we're behind in our commitments to other people, we will both work 14 hours a day until we're caught up.”  
我一生都有很棒的合作伙伴。我想我得到它们的部分原因是我试图配得上它们，部分原因是我足够明智地选择了它们，部分原因可能是运气。但我在人生的一个小阶段选择的两个合作伙伴遵循以下规则，他们创建了一个小型的设计-构建施工团队。他们坐下来说：“两人合作。把一切都平分。规则是这样的：每当我们未能兑现对他人的承诺时，我们都会每天工作 14 小时，直到我们赶上为止。”

Well, needless to say, that firm didn’t fail! The people died rich. It’s such a simple idea.  
好吧，不用说，那家公司并没有失败！人们死时富有。这是一个非常简单的想法。

Another thing, of course, is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows. Doesn’t matter. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well. Every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something and your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity, but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion. That is a very good idea.  
当然，另一件事是，生活会遭受可怕的打击，可怕的打击，不公平的打击。没关系。有些人康复了，有些人则没有。我认为爱比克泰德的态度是最好的。他认为生活中的每一次不幸都是表现良好的机会。生活中的每一次不幸都是学习的机会，你的责任不是沉浸在自怜中，而是以建设性的方式利用可怕的打击。这是一个非常好的主意。

And you may remember the epitaph which Epictetus left for himself: “Here lies Epictetus, a slave, maimed in body, the ultimate in poverty, and favored of the gods.”  
你可能还记得爱比克泰德为自己留下的墓志铭：“这里长眠着爱比克泰德，一个身体残缺的奴隶，极度贫困，受到众神的青睐。”

Well, that’s the way Epictetus is now remembered. He said big consequences. And he was favorite of the Gods! He was favored because he became wise, and he became manly. Very good idea.  
嗯，这就是爱比克泰德现在被人们铭记的方式。他说后果很严重。而且他是众神的最爱！他受到宠爱，因为他变得聪明，而且变得有男子气概。非常好的主意。

I got a final little idea because I’m all for prudence as well as opportunism. My grandfather was the only federal judge in his city for nearly forty years and I really admired him. I’m his namesake. And I’m Confucian enough that, even now, I sit here and I’m saying, “Well, Judge Munger would be pleased to see me here.”  
我最后有了一个小想法，因为我既支持谨慎，也支持机会主义。近四十年来，我的祖父是他所在城市唯一的联邦法官，我真的很钦佩他。我是他的同名者。我是一个足够儒家的人，即使是现在，我坐在这里也会说，“好吧，芒格法官会很高兴在这里见到我。”

So I'm Confucian enough, all these years after my grandfather is dead, to carry the torch for my grandfather's values. And, grandfather Munger was a federal judge at a time when there were no pensions for widows of federal judges. So if he didn't save from his income, why, my grandmother would have been in penury. And being the kind of man he was he underspent his income all his life and left her in comfortable circumstances.  
所以，在我祖父去世后的这些年里，我已经足够儒家了，能够继承祖父的价值观。而且，祖父芒格担任联邦法官时，联邦法官的遗孀没有养老金。因此，如果他不从收入中存钱，为什么，我祖母就会陷入贫困。作为这样的人，他一生都少花自己的收入，让她过着舒适的生活。

Along the way, in the thirties, my uncle's bank failed and couldn't reopen. And my grandfather saved the bank by taking over a third of his assets—good assets—and putting them into the bank and taking the horrible assets in exchange. And, of course, it did save the bank.  
一路走来，在三十年代，我叔叔的银行倒闭了，无法重新开业。我的祖父通过接管他三分之一以上的资产（优质资产）并将其放入银行并以糟糕的资产作为交换来拯救了银行。当然，它确实拯救了银行。

While my grandfather took a loss, he got most of his money back eventually. But I've always remembered the example. And so when I got to college and I came across Houseman, I remember the little poem from Houseman, and that went something like this:  
虽然我祖父遭受了损失，但他最终还是拿回了大部分钱。但我一直记得这个例子。所以当我上大学时，我遇到了豪斯曼，我记得豪斯曼的一首小诗，内容是这样的：

*“The thoughts of others “别人的想法  
Were light and fleeting,  
轻盈而转瞬即逝，  
Of lovers' meeting  恋人聚会的时候  
Or luck or fame.  
或是运气，或是名誉。  
Mine were of trouble,  
我的有麻烦了，  
And mine were steady;  
我的也很稳定；  
So I was ready  
所以我准备好了  
When trouble came.”  当麻烦来临时。”*

You can say, “Who wants to go through life anticipating trouble?” Well, I did! All my life, I've gone through life anticipating trouble. And here I am, well along on my eighty-fourth year, and like Epictetus, I've had a favored life. It didn't make me unhappy to anticipate trouble all the time and be ready to perform adequately if trouble came. It didn't hurt me at all. In fact, it helped me. So I quick claim to you Houseman and Judge Munger.  
你可以说：“谁愿意一生都在期待着麻烦呢？”嗯，我做到了！我一生都在期待着麻烦。我现在已经八十四岁了，和爱比克泰德一样，我过着幸福的生活。一直预见到麻烦并准备好在麻烦出现时充分表现，这并没有让我不高兴。它根本没有伤害我。事实上，它对我有帮助。所以我很快就向豪斯曼和芒格法官提出了要求。

The last idea that I want to give you, as you go out into a profession that frequently puts a lot of procedure, and a lot of precautions, and a lot of mumbo-jumbo into what it does, this is not the highest form which civilization can reach. The highest form that civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust. Not much procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another.  
我想给你的最后一个想法是，当你进入一个经常需要大量程序、大量预防措施以及大量胡言乱语的职业时，这并不是最高级的形式。文明可以达到。文明所能达到的最高形式是一个无缝的值得信任的网络。没有太多的程序，只是完全可靠的人正确地相互信任。

That's the way an operating room works at the Mayo Clinic. If a bunch of lawyers were to introduce a lot of process, the patients would all die. So never forget, when you're a lawyer, that you may be rewarded for selling this stuff, but you don't have to buy it. In your own life, what you want is a seamless web of deserved trust. And if your proposed marriage contract has forty-seven pages, my suggestion is you not enter.  
这就是梅奥诊所手术室的工作方式。如果一群律师引入很多流程，病人都会死。所以永远不要忘记，当你是一名律师时，你可能会因为出售这些东西而获得奖励，但你不必购买它。在你自己的生活中，你想要的是一个值得信任的无缝网络。如果你提议的结婚合同有四十七页，我的建议是你不要参加。

Well, that’s enough for one graduation. I hope these ruminations of an old man are useful to you. In the end, I’m like the Old Valiant-for-Truth in The Pilgrim’s Progress: “My sword I leave to him who can wear it.”  
好吧，这对于一次毕业来说就足够了。希望这位老人的这些思考对你有用。最后，我就像《天路历程》中的老勇者一样：“我把我的剑留给能佩戴它的人。”
