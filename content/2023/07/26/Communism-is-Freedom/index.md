Ideas about a future society won't in themselves bring us to a better future, but ideas can function as points of orientation for collective struggle. What should the communism we fight for look like?

关于未来社会的想法本身并不会给我们带来更美好的未来，但想法可以作为集体斗争的方向。我们为之奋斗的共产主义应该是什么样子？

[Søren Mau  索伦·茂](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/blogs/news/tagged/article-author-s%C3%B8ren-mau)18 July 2023 2023 年 7 月 18 日

![Communism is Freedom](https://www.versobooks.com/cdn/shop/articles/Soren_copy.jpg?v=1689788203&width=1128)

Few are still defending capitalism. Most have recognized its absurdity, and critiques of the existing system are usually preaching to the choir, because the ideological conflict is no longer between those who defend capitalism and those who reject it, but rather between hope and resignation. As anti-capitalists, our task today is perhaps not so much to convince others that capitalism is destructive, but rather to strengthen the belief in the actual possibility of organizing our shared life in an entirely different and better way.

很少有人仍在捍卫资本主义。大多数人都认识到它的荒谬性，对现有制度的批评通常是对合唱团的说教，因为意识形态冲突不再是捍卫资本主义的人和拒绝资本主义的人之间的冲突，而是希望和放弃之间的冲突。作为反资本主义者，我们今天的任务也许不是让其他人相信资本主义具有破坏性，而是增强人们对以一种完全不同的、更好的方式组织我们共同生活的实际可能性的信念。

Contrary to what many intellectuals are led by their vanity to believe, strengthening such a belief is generally not a question of having the right ideas, arguments, and analyses. It’s rather the result of having concrete experiences of being able to act and make changes together with other people. If millions of people in the early decades of the 20th century considered socialism to be a real possibility within reach, it wasn’t because socialist intellectuals had finally managed to sufficiently sharpen their arguments, but because the worker’s movement in its heyday had created political organizations that were capable of giving people a lived experience of accomplishing concrete improvements in their quality of life by means of collective action. Beautiful utopias don’t matter if they’re not accompanied by a confidence in the ability of collective action to change the course of history, and such a confidence can’t be conjured up by good arguments: political communities is the inevitable basis for ideas about another and better society.

与许多知识分子受虚荣心引导的信念相反，加强这种信念通常不是拥有正确的想法、论据和分析的问题。相反，这是拥有能够与其他人一起行动和做出改变的具体经验的结果。如果在20世纪初的几十年里，数百万人认为社会主义是触手可及的现实可能性，那并不是因为社会主义知识分子最终成功地充分阐明了他们的论点，而是因为工人运动在其鼎盛时期创建了政治组织它们能够让人们亲身体验通过集体行动实现生活质量的具体改善。如果没有对集体行动改变历史进程的能力的信心，美丽的乌托邦就毫无意义，而这种信心不能通过好的论据来唤起：政治共同体是思想的必然基础关于另一个更好的社会。

That doesn’t mean, however, that ideas don’t matter. Ideas about the good society can never *in themselves* create historical changes, but that doesn’t prevent them from being *a part of* such a process. In the right political and historical circumstances, ideas can function as points of orientation, which can help us make decisions about how to act. That’s why it makes sense to have discussions about what a free society could look like. And that’s something that anti-capitalists have neglected for way too long.

然而，这并不意味着想法不重要。关于美好社会的理念本身永远无法创造历史性变革，但这并不妨碍它们成为这一进程的一部分。在正确的政治和历史环境下，思想可以作为方向点，帮助我们决定如何行动。这就是为什么讨论自由社会会是什么样子是有意义的。这是反资本主义者长期以来忽视的事情。

Fortunately, there are signs that things are changing. More and more people are thinking about what a postcapitalist society could look like, and discussions about ‘[degrowth communism](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/marx-in-the-anthropocene/D58765916F0CB624FCCBB61F50879376)’, ‘[half-earth socialism](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2650-half-earth-socialism)’, ‘[fully automated luxury communism](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/476-fully-automated-luxury-communism)’, ‘[post-scarcity](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2682-automation-and-the-future-of-work)’, ‘[salvage communism](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2738-the-tragedy-of-the-worker)’ and ‘[the world commune](https://endnotes.org.uk/articles/contours-of-the-world-commune.pdf)’ are proliferating. Last year, [M.E. O’Brien](https://www.plutobooks.com/9780745343846/family-abolition/) and Eman Abdelhadi published a vision for a communist New York City, *[Everything for Everyone: An Oral History of the New York Commune](https://www.commonnotions.org/everything-for-everyone), 2052-2072*, and authors such as [Aaron Benanav](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/blogs/authors/benanav-aaron), [Jasper Bernes](https://endnotes.org.uk/articles/revolutionary-motives.pdf) and [Cordelia Belton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ev-IlUaJc&t=6255s) are all currently writing books about communism that will hopefully soon be published and will surely constitute important contributions to the contemporary discussions about the economic and political structures of our communist future.

幸运的是，有迹象表明情况正在发生变化。越来越多的人在思考后资本主义社会会是什么样子，并讨论“去增长共产主义”、“半个地球社会主义”、“全自动豪华共产主义”、“后稀缺”、“拯救共产主义”和“ “世界公社”正在激增。去年，M.E. O'Brien 和 Eman Abdelhadi 发表了共产主义纽约市的愿景《一切为了每个人：2052-2072 年纽约公社的口述历史》，Aaron Benanav、Jasper Bernes 和 Cordelia Belton 等作者也发表了这一愿景。所有目前正在撰写的有关共产主义的书籍有望很快出版，并且必将为当代关于我们共产主义未来的经济和政治结构的讨论做出重要贡献。

**Communism is Democracy 共产主义就是民主**

Under capitalism, a society’s economic activities are organized according to one single principle: *profit*. Most decisions about what and how much to produce, who should produce it, where and how it should be produced, and who should receive the yields of production are left to profit-seeking private actors. Communism doesn’t consist in replacing this principle with another economic principle, but rather in enabling democratic decision-making about how our shared activities and resources should be organized.

在资本主义下，社会的经济活动是根据一个原则组织的：利润。关于生产什么和多少、谁应该生产、在哪里生产、如何生产以及谁应该获得生产收益的大多数决定都留给了追求利润的私人行为者。共产主义并不在于用另一种经济原则取代这一原则，而是在于就如何组织我们共享的活动和资源进行民主决策。

Humans are *social* beings insofar as they live in groups and are dependent on each other for their survival, and they are *natural* beings insofar as they are dependent on an ecosystem that belongs to no one and therefore to *everyone*. An individual’s access to their own material conditions of existence is always mediated by social relations, which is another way of saying that it is always a *political* issue, and for this reason, freedom can never merely consist in the absence of the power of the community over the individual, but must also consist in the possibility on the part of individuals to participate in the political processes that shape their relationships to their conditions of existence. Put differently, humans are by nature political animals, whose freedom can only be realized and maintained through collective self-determination—or what we call *democracy*. Communism is the aspiration to take this democratic ideal as seriously as possible and is, as such, a vision of freedom. Democracy must, as [Ellen Meiksins Wood](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/blogs/authors/wood-ellen-meiksins), put it, “be reconceived not simply as a political category but as an economic one,[… i.e.] as an economic regulator, the *driving mechanism* of the economy”.

人类是社会存在，因为他们生活在群体中并相互依赖才能生存；他们是自然存在，因为他们依赖于一个不属于任何人、因此属于每个人的生态系统。个人对自身物质生存条件的获取总是通过社会关系来调节的，换句话说，这始终是一个政治问题，因此，自由绝不能仅仅存在于缺乏社会力量的情况下。个人的权利，但也必须包括个人参与政治进程的可能性，这些政治进程塑造了他们与其生存条件的关系。换句话说，人类本质上是政治动物，其自由只能通过集体自决——或者我们所说的民主——来实现和维护。共产主义是尽可能认真对待这一民主理想的愿望，因此也是一种自由的愿景。正如埃伦·梅克辛斯·伍德（Ellen Meiksins Wood）所说，民主必须“不仅被重新视为一种政治范畴，而且被重新视为一种经济范畴，[……即作为经济调节者、经济驱动机制”。

**Not a Lifestyle 不是一种生活方式**

Communism doesn’t imply a particular idea of the good life. Communism isn’t a lifestyle or a fantasy about making every facet of an individual’s life the object of political decision-making; it isn’t a romantic community cult or a dream of communes and potlucks and DIY culture. Communism is the effort to establish institutions that can ensure the highest possible degree of individual freedom and democratic control over those aspects of human life that are, necessarily, shared by the members of a society. Communism is just as much for introverts and hermits as it is for enthusiastic collectivists.

共产主义并不意味着特定的美好生活理念。共产主义不是一种生活方式，也不是一种让个人生活的方方面面都成为政治决策对象的幻想；而是一种生活方式。这不是一种浪漫的社区崇拜，也不是公社、聚餐和 DIY 文化的梦想。共产主义是努力建立能够确保尽可能高程度的个人自由和对人类生活的那些必然由社会成员共享的方面的民主控制的机构。共产主义既适合内向者和隐士，也适合热情的集体主义者。

Communism relies on the acknowledgement that there are aspects of our life that are ontologically collective, and which therefore cannot be left to individuals. The best example is land: originally it belongs to *no one*, and thus to *everyone*, which is why decisions about what to do with it have to be democratic decisions. The communization of our shared conditions of existence isn’t based on a moral claim about the common or the collective as somehow finer or better or higher than the individual, but on the simple insight that the reproduction of the human species is inherently social, and that the total democratization of the shared aspects of this reproduction is the only reasonable consequence of that fact. All aspects of life that can be taken care of individually, however, will as a rule remain individual issues.

共产主义依赖于这样一种认识：我们生活的某些方面在本体论上是集体的，因此不能留给个人。最好的例子是土地：最初它不属于任何人，因此属于每个人，这就是为什么关于如何处理土地的决定必须是民主决定。我们共同的生存条件的共产化并不是基于对共同或集体在某种程度上比个人更好、更好或更高的道德主张，而是基于这样一个简单的认识：人类物种的繁衍本质上是社会性的，并且这种复制的共同方面的完全民主化是这一事实的唯一合理的结果。然而，生活中可以单独处理的所有方面通常仍然是个人问题。

The fundamental condition of communism is that the basic conditions of the life of society are brought under democratic control. The state would be abolished, all private companies would be dissolved, and all privately owned means of production—land, buildings, machines, etc.—as well as the wealth of the upper class would be expropriated. At the same time, new institutions would need to be built, which would not only take over many of the functions we usually associate with the state today, but would also manage and oversee the economy.

共产主义的根本条件是社会生活的基本条件处于民主控制之下。国家将被废除，所有私营公司将被解散，所有私有生产资料——土地、建筑物、机器等——以及上层阶级的财富将被没收。与此同时，需要建立新的机构，这些机构不仅要接管我们今天通常与国家联系在一起的许多职能，还要管理和监督经济。

What is at stake here is thus a wide-ranging and comprehensive expansion of democracy. Instead of leaving economic decisions to market forces, *we* would be the ones deciding what it is *we* want. 

因此，这里的关键是民主的广泛而全面的扩展。我们不会把经济决策交给市场力量，而是由我们自己决定我们想要什么。

**The Commune 公社**

Let’s call the basic unit of the institutional structure of communism *the* *commune*. Everyone would have to choose a home commune, but everyone would be able to live in whatever commune they would choose. Communes would vary in size, depending on their revolutionary prehistory as well their particular geographic, cultural, and historical context. Some communes would be heavily urbanized and count their inhabitants—let’s call them *communards*—in the millions, while communes in sparsely populated areas or desolated islands could have very few inhabitants, at least to begin with. Communism will gradually diminish the divide between city and countryside, but to begin with, it will be necessary to build communism in a world shaped by centuries of intense capitalist urbanization, which means that heavily urbanized areas such as Tokyo or Shanghai would have to be transformed into several large urban communes.

我们把共产主义制度结构的基本单位称为公社。每个人都必须选择一个家庭公社，但每个人都可以住在他们选择的任何公社中。公社的规模会有所不同，具体取决于其革命史前以及特定的地理、文化和历史背景。一些公社将高度城市化，其居民（我们称其为公社居民）数以百万计，而位于人口稀少地区或荒凉岛屿的公社可能只有很少的居民，至少在一开始是这样。共产主义将逐渐缩小城乡之间的鸿沟，但首先，有必要在一个经历了几个世纪的资本主义城市化的世界中建立共产主义，这意味着东京或上海等高度城市化的地区必须进行改造分为几个大型城市公社。

Ideally, each commune would control everything necessary to cover the needs of its communards, from land, water, energy, and other natural resources to labor power, technology, research, and education. Decisions should generally be made by—or as close as possible to—those affected by them to ensure a high degree of autonomy and minimize the risk of undemocratic centralization of power.

理想情况下，每个公社都将控制满足其公社需求所需的一切，从土地、水、能源和其他自然资源到劳动力、技术、研究和教育。决策通常应由受其影响的人或尽可能接近的人做出，以确保高度自治并最大限度地减少不民主的集权风险。

In practice, this is an ideal impossible to realize, partly because one of the basic conditions of all communes is a stable biosphere, and that can only be guaranteed through some sort of global regulation of the use of our common natural resources. Moreover, there would be obvious advantages to cooperation between communes. Two neighboring communes might, for example, decide to pool their resources around infrastructure or education. Such agreements between communes would likely result in some sort of pyramid structure consisting of political institutions with decision-making power as well as forums for coordination, knowledge-sharing, and reciprocal aid.

实际上，这是一个不可能实现的理想，部分原因是所有公社的基本条件之一是稳定的生物圈，而这只能通过对我们共同自然资源的使用进行某种全球监管来保证。而且，公社之间的合作优势也很明显。例如，两个相邻的公社可能决定将资源集中在基础设施或教育方面。公社之间的此类协议可能会导致某种金字塔结构，其中包括具有决策权的政治机构以及协调、知识共享和互助的论坛。

Under communism, referendums would be more common, but not all decisions could be made this way, so there would also need to be representative assemblies, whose seats could be filled through a combination of elections and lotteries, which would counteract the formation of a political elite and the market-imitating professionalization of politics.

在共产主义制度下，全民公决会更常见，但并不是所有的决定都能通过这种方式做出，因此还需要有代表大会，其席位可以通过选举和抽签相结合的方式来填补，这将阻碍政治政治体制的形成。精英和效仿市场的政治专业化。

Perhaps the most important task of the commune would be passing and executing the economic plans that would replace market mechanisms. It might look something like this: all communards and production facilities would regularly report their needs and wants, and based on publicly available data on these needs and wants, as well as on available resources and production capacity, different political organizations would propose drafts for economic plans outlining production targets for a two-year period. This process would be repeated several times in conjunction with public meetings and hearings and various forms of public debates to ensure a maximum level of democratic participation. Eventually, a final plan would be passed by referendum. Decisions regarding the exact details of the implementation would be made by representative assemblies in collaboration with production units.

也许公社最重要的任务是通过和执行取代市场机制的经济计划。它可能看起来像这样：所有公社和生产设施都会定期报告他们的需求和愿望，并根据这些需求和愿望的公开数据以及可用资源和生产能力，不同的政治组织将提出经济草案计划概述了两年期间的生产目标。这一过程将与公开会议和听证会以及各种形式的公开辩论一起重复多次，以确保最大程度的民主参与。最终，最终计划将通过全民投票获得通过。有关实施具体细节的决定将由代表大会与生产单位合作做出。

**The Public Sector 公共部门**

Under communism, the economy would be divided into two sectors. [Aaron Benanav](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2682-automation-and-the-future-of-work) borrows from Marx and calls them *the realm of necessity* and th*e realm of freedom*. We could also call them the public sector and the private sector. In the public sector—or the realm of necessity—“we would share out” as Benanav puts it, “the labors necessary for our collective reproduction, dividing up responsibilities while taking into account individual abilities and proclivities.” This would include, among other things, agriculture, healthcare, housing, education, research, childcare, elderly care, public transportation, infrastructure, media, consumer goods, and what we today call capital goods.

在共产主义制度下，经济将分为两个部门。亚伦·贝纳纳夫（Aaron Benanav）借用了马克思的观点，称其为必然领域和自由领域。我们也可以将它们称为公共部门和私营部门。在公共部门——或者说必需品领域——正如贝纳纳夫所说，“我们将分享集体再生产所需的劳动，在考虑个人能力和倾向的同时划分责任。”其中包括农业、医疗保健、住房、教育、研究、儿童保育、老年人护理、公共交通、基础设施、媒体、消费品以及我们今天所说的资本货物。

The two-year plans described above can be thought of as a list of everything to be produced by the public sector, which can then be converted to a certain amount of labor hours required to reach these targets. These hours would, ideally, be distributed evenly among all adult communards fit for work, and specific tasks would be allocated according to each individual’s abilities and needs. Thus, everyone might, for example, be required to work twenty hours a week.

上述两年计划可以被视为公共部门要制定的所有事项的清单，然后可以将其转换为实现这些目标所需的一定劳动时间。理想情况下，这些时间将平均分配给所有适合工作的成年公社成员，具体任务将根据每个人的能力和需求进行分配。因此，例如，每个人可能需要每周工作二十个小时。

Under capitalism, a significant part of the labor most necessary to the maintenance of life is rendered invisible or privatized as unpaid domestic labor. The capitalist separation of paid and unpaid labor, of production and reproduction, which is an important source of gendered oppression, would disappear under communism, where reproductive labor would count as a part of the commune’s shared workload.

在资本主义制度下，维持生命最必需的劳动的很大一部分被隐形或私有化为无偿家务劳动。资本主义对有偿劳动和无偿劳动、生产和再生产的分离是性别压迫的一个重要根源，而在共产主义下，这种分离将会消失，在共产主义下，再生产劳动将被视为公社共同工作量的一部分。

In order to be sure the needs of the commune align with the needs and capabilities of the communards, various incentives could be used—a particularly unpopular task might, for instance, count for double the hours or come with special privileges, such as access to more attractive housing or more attractive working conditions. More popular tasks could be assigned by lottery or bundled with unpopular ones. A similar strategy could be used to ensure that the commune’s education system is set up to meet the projected needs of the commune to avoid shortages of specialized labor. In that way, it would be possible to create a division of labor in which most tasks would be equally attractive, and in which certain groups of people wouldn’t be forced to take on the worst tasks—as they currently are under capitalism.

为了确保公社的需求与公社成员的需求和能力相一致，可以使用各种激励措施——例如，一项特别不受欢迎的任务可能需要双倍的工作时间或附带特殊特权，例如获得更有吸引力的住房或更有吸引力的工作条件。更受欢迎的任务可以通过抽签分配或与不受欢迎的任务捆绑在一起。可以使用类似的策略来确保公社的教育系统的建立能够满足公社的预计需求，以避免专业劳动力的短缺。这样，就有可能创造一种劳动分工，在这种分工中，大多数任务都同样有吸引力，并且某些群体不会被迫承担最糟糕的任务——就像他们目前在资本主义制度下一样。

Everything produced in the public sector would be distributed without the use of money. Housing, healthcare, medicine, education, childcare, public transportation, and meals in public cafeterias would be free of charge and available to all, without control. Housing would be assigned through lottery and waitlists. The basic idea underlying public libraries could be extended to things such as tools, bicycles, music instruments, art, and clothing, as the Danish politician [Pelle Dragsted](https://jacobin.com/2021/10/socialism-state-ownership-redistribution-power-cooperatives-neoliberalism-social-democracy) has recently suggested.

公共部门生产的所有产品都将在不使用金钱的情况下进行分配。住房、医疗保健、医疗、教育、儿童保育、公共交通和公共食堂的膳食将免费向所有人提供，不受控制。住房将通过抽签和候补名单分配。正如丹麦政治家 Pelle Dragsted 最近建议的那样，公共图书馆的基本理念可以扩展到工具、自行车、乐器、艺术品和服装等领域。

Consumer goods associated with varying individual preferences (I like to drink vermouth, you might prefer sherry) could be ‘purchased’ with digital coupons. All communards would receive coupons each week to use for services and products available from public warehouses. This wouldn’t be money, since the coupons would be personal and expire after a certain period (let’s say three months, for example), which means that they can’t be transferred and accumulated.

与不同个人喜好相关的消费品（我喜欢喝苦艾酒，你可能更喜欢雪利酒）可以用数字优惠券“购买”。所有公社每周都会收到优惠券，用于购买公共仓库提供的服务和产品。这不是钱，因为优惠券是个人的，并且会在一定期限（例如三个月）后过期，这意味着它们无法转让和累积。

**The Private Sector 私营部门**

The commune would produce and distribute everything necessary for all communards to live a good, long, healthy, and stable life. It would be responsible for building and maintaining housing, electricity, roads, sanitation, railroads, the internet; it would produce your food and your medicine, your clothes, your phone, your furniture, your television, and your books; it would take care of you, your children, the elderly, and the sick.

公社将生产和分配所有公社人民过上美好、长寿、健康和稳定生活所需的一切。它将负责建设和维护住房、电力、道路、卫生、铁路、互联网；它会生产你的食物、你的药品、你的衣服、你的电话、你的家具、你的电视和你的书籍；它会照顾你、你的孩子、老人和病人。

But the commune wouldn’t be able to meet *all* the communards’ needs. Under capitalism, it is the effective demand of individuals that determine what gets produced: ‘the social power becomes the private power of private persons’, as Marx put it in *Capital*. Under communism, decisions about what to produce would instead be taken democratically, which means that the commune might decide not to produce certain products even though some communards would like it to. In such cases, communards would as a rule be free to produce these things themselves in their free time.

但公社无法满足公社成员的所有需求。在资本主义制度下，个人的有效需求决定了生产结果：正如马克思在《资本论》中所说的那样，“社会权力变成了私人的私人权力”。在共产主义制度下，生产什么的决定将以民主方式做出，这意味着公社可能会决定不生产某些产品，即使一些公社成员愿意。在这种情况下，公社成员通常可以在空闲时间自由地自己生产这些东西。

Products that the commune has opted to not include in its economic plan could be produced by the private sector, or in *the realm of freedom*—that is, the part of a society’s economy that the communards would manage in their free time. Here, everyone would produce and trade as they wish, keeping within certain democratically determined limits (no production or exchange of humans, weapons, or hard drugs, for example). The communards would also be able to create institutions and technologies that could ease and regulate exchange—for example, creating some sort of money.

公社选择不纳入其经济计划的产品可以由私营部门或自由领域生产——即公社成员在空闲时间管理的社会经济的一部分。在这里，每个人都可以按照自己的意愿进行生产和贸易，并保持在一定的民主确定的限制范围内（例如，不生产或交换人类、武器或硬性毒品）。公社成员还能够创建能够缓解和规范交换的机构和技术，例如创造某种货币。

Imagine, for example, that we have democratically decided that in order to reduce working time for everyone, the commune will only produce bicycles in one color. If a communard desperately wants a red bicycle, they will be able to pick up an unpainted bicycle from a public warehouse (for free, of course, like everything else) and paint it themselves. Or maybe they will take it to a bicycle workshop that a group of communards have established in their freetime, and have them paint it in exchange for something else. As this example hopefully makes clear, ‘the private sector’ is basically just a name for those productive activities that communards engage in in their free time.

例如，想象一下，我们民主决定，为了减少每个人的工作时间，公社将只生产一种颜色的自行车。如果一个公社非常想要一辆红色自行车，他们可以从公共仓库拿起一辆未上漆的自行车（当然，像其他东西一样免费）并自己上漆。或者也许他们会把它带到一群社区成员在空闲时间建立的自行车车间，让他们给它喷漆以换取其他东西。正如这个例子所希望表明的那样，“私营部门”基本上只是公社在空闲时间从事的那些生产性活动的名称。

The line between the two sectors would be drawn democratically by the commune. Each time, it’s a matter of asking: Is this a need we agree to take on collective responsibility for, or is this something we leave to communards to take care of themselves? Energy, buildings, and raw materials required for production outside of the public sector would be granted by the commune, either for free or in exchange for products or services.

这两个部门之间的界限将由公社民主地划定。每次，我们都会问：这是我们同意承担集体责任的需要，还是我们让公社人士自己照顾的事情？公共部门之外的生产所需的能源、建筑和原材料将由公社免费或以产品或服务交换的形式提供。

But isn’t this private sector merely another form of capitalism? The answer is no, because the commune would always guarantee all communards unconditioned access to life necessities, which means that it would always be possible to withdraw completely from the private sector. Land, housing, and labor power would never become commodities. Money would exist purely as an means of exchange and couldn’t be used to give certain people power over others.

但这种私营部门难道不是资本主义的另一种形式吗？答案是否定的，因为公社总是会保证所有公社成员无条件获得生活必需品，这意味着它总是有可能完全退出私营部门。土地、住房和劳动力永远不会成为商品。金钱纯粹作为一种交换手段而存在，不能用来赋予某些人凌驾于他人之上的权力。

**Life under Communism 共产主义下的生活**

For centuries, capitalism has prioritized profit over nature, and as a result, we are now left with what the communist author [Eskil Halberg](https://eskilhalberg.dk/) has called a fixer-upper of a planet. We need what The Salvage Collective, in their 2021 manifesto, *[The Tragedy of the Worker](https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/2738-the-tragedy-of-the-worker)*, calls a salvage communism, meaning that a significant part of the commune’s resources would need to be dedicated to ecological restoration. The democratization of our common resources would make it possible to regulate the use of natural resources, and thereby to secure the conditions of existence for future generations of humans and the other living creatures we share this earth with.

几个世纪以来，资本主义将利润置于自然之上，结果，我们现在只剩下共产主义作家埃斯基尔·哈尔伯格所说的地球的修复体。我们需要救助集体在其 2021 年宣言《工人的悲剧》中所说的救助共产主义，这意味着公社的大部分资源需要专门用于生态恢复。我们共同资源的民主化将使规范自然资源的使用成为可能，从而确保人类子孙后代和与我们共享地球的其他生物的生存条件。

The idea of of communism I’ve described here is as dissimilar from the authoritarian state socialism of the 20th century as it is from capitalism. So why insist on calling it “communism” at all, a word so strongly associated with Stalinist dictatorship? For the same reason that we shouldn’t give up the concept of “democracy” because of the German Democratic Republic or the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. Some words are worth fighting for, and instead of abandoning the concept of communism to the typically bourgeois falsification of history, we should insist on continuing the long, unbroken tradition that—in explicit opposition to authoritarian state socialism—has been fighting for a free society under the banner of communism for over more than 150 years.

我在这里描述的共产主义理念与 20 世纪的专制国家社会主义不同，也与资本主义不同。那么，为什么坚持称其为“共产主义”，这个词与斯大林主义独裁制度有着如此密切的联系呢？同样的道理，我们不应该因为德意志民主共和国或朝鲜民主主义人民共和国而放弃“民主”的概念。有些话是值得为之奋斗的，我们不应该放弃共产主义的概念，而去接受典型的资产阶级对历史的歪曲，而应该坚持延续长期的、不间断的传统——明确反对专制国家社会主义——一直在为自由社会而奋斗150多年来，我们一直在共产主义旗帜下奋斗。

So, what would life under communism look like? Above all, a communist society would be free, classless, and diverse. Communism would give everyone the freedom to shape their own lives as they wish. Communism would be synonymous with more democratic decision-making, fewer working hours, better housing, better food, and a stable biosphere, as well as with something capitalism can never offer—economic security. Under capitalism, you never know when layoffs, inflation, or an economic crisis will rip the rug out from under you; under communism, no one would ever need to fear being cut off from access to basic life necessities. A communist life will, in other words, be free, secure, and good—for *all*. 

那么，共产主义下的生活会是什么样子呢？最重要的是，共产主义社会将是自由、无阶级和多元化的。共产主义将给予每个人按照自己的意愿塑造自己生活的自由。共产主义将是更民主的决策、更少的工作时间、更好的住房、更好的食物和稳定的生物圈的代名词，以及资本主义永远无法提供的东西——经济安全。在资本主义制度下，你永远不知道什么时候裁员、通货膨胀或经济危机会让你崩溃。在共产主义制度下，没有人需要担心被切断获得基本生活必需品的机会。换句话说，共产主义生活对所有人来说都是自由、安全和美好的。
