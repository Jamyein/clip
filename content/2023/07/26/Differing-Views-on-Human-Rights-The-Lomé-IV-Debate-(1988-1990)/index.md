**By Alessandro Favilli 亚历山德罗·法维利**

The Lomé Conventions were development cooperation agreements (1975-2000) between the European Economic Community (EEC) and a large group of developing countries from Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP). In 1975, the signatories of the first Lomé Convention named it [one of the most innovative cooperative agreements between developed and developing countries](http://aei.pitt.edu/1776/). The agreements were based on the principles of equality among the partners and political neutrality, and covered areas such as industrial cooperation, trade, and development aid. Among these principles, the importance of political neutrality was pivotal: the EEC’s aid was free of any economic and political conditions. For this reason, the first Lomé Convention (1975), did not include any provisions regarding respect for human rights. The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of the ACP countries was one of the pillars of the first Convention.

《洛美公约》是欧洲经济共同体 (EEC) 与众多非洲、加勒比和太平洋地区 (ACP) 发展中国家 (ACP) 之间的发展合作协议（1975-2000 年）。 1975年，第一个《洛美公约》的签署国将其称为发达国家与发展中国家之间最具创新性的合作协议之一。这些协议基于伙伴之间平等和政治中立的原则，涵盖产业合作、贸易和发展援助等领域。在这些原则中，政治中立的重要性至关重要：欧洲经济共同体的援助不附带任何经济和政治条件。因此，第一个《洛美公约》（1975 年）没有包含任何有关尊重人权的条款。不干涉非加太国家内政原则是第一个公约的支柱之一。

This early exclusion did not last for long. The notion of human rights was officially introduced to Lomé in 1984 and gained increased importance in the following years. One of the central passages of the Lomé human rights debate took place between 1988 and 1990 in the official periodical of the Convention, [The Courier](http://aei.pitt.edu/view/eusries/EXTERNAL=2FDEVELOPMENT=3ACourier,_The.html). As I will show, formulating a working definition of human rights was a long process involving passionate debates between EEC and ACP scholars. The Convention was one of the few institutional contexts where intellectuals and politicians from both developed and developing countries could debate the nature of human rights and their relation to development. Remarkably, it has received very little attention from international law scholars and intellectual historians. The debate displayed vital differences in the theoretical understandings of human rights advanced by EEC and ACP intellectuals. Hence, Lomé IV was likely one of the most consequential intellectual exchanges between developed and developing countries in the late 20th century.

这种早期的排斥并没有持续多久。人权概念于 1984 年正式引入洛美，并在接下来的几年中变得越来越重要。 1988 年至 1990 年间，洛美人权辩论的核心段落之一出现在《公约》的官方期刊《信使报》上。正如我将要展示的那样，制定人权的工作定义是一个漫长的过程，涉及欧洲经济共同体和非加太学者之间的激烈辩论。该公约是发达国家和发展中国家的知识分子和政治家可以就人权的性质及其与发展的关系进行辩论的少数制度环境之一。值得注意的是，它很少受到国际法学者和思想史学家的关注。这场辩论显示了欧共体和非加太知识分子对人权的理论理解存在重大差异。因此，洛美四世可能是20世纪末发达国家和发展中国家之间最重要的知识交流之一。

The EEC tried to include the notion of human rights in the Convention already during Lomé II negotiations between 1977 and 1979. However, ACP intellectuals like Humphrey Assisi Asobie viewed these attempts as “[a useful opportunity [for the EC States] to impose their conception of the relationship between the individual and the State](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43658094).” ACP intellectuals, mainly from Africa, believed that the way in which Europeans conceptualized human rights was unsuited to the African reality, which prioritized [commonality](https://www.jstor.org/stable/761878?searchText=josiah+cobbah&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Djosiah%2Bcobbah&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3A6f66f51b661393bf3d3334cfd5da93ed), [socio-economic rights](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4186405?searchText=claude+ake&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dclaude%2Bake&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Adb8cff9ce18b99aaf62ec548e6fadf75), and the [right to development](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23015981?searchText=keba+mbaye&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dkeba%2Bmbaye&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Ad3760be43afe2df53283c7ab2af72ec2). The discussion continued in the 1980s: human rights were included in the preamble of Lomé III but excluded from the [main text](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/79ab6237-6c16-4e67-902c-0c71df7f77c2/language-en).

欧共体在 1977 年至 1979 年间的洛美二世谈判期间就已尝试将人权概念纳入《公约》。然而，汉弗莱·阿西西·阿索比等 ACP 知识分子认为这些尝试是“[对于欧共体国家]强加他们的人权观念的一个有用机会。个人与国家之间的关系。”主要来自非洲的非加太知识分子认为，欧洲人对人权的概念不适合非洲的现实，非洲的现实优先考虑共同性、社会经济权利和发展权。讨论在 20 世纪 80 年代继续进行：人权被纳入《洛美三世》的序言中，但被排除在正文之外。

With the growing insistence of donors and increasing contributions of African intellectuals to human rights scholarship, the forthcoming negotiation of Lomé IV became one of the crucial settings for a heated theoretical debate between radically different conceptions of human rights. In his 1987 article “[The African Context of Human Rights](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4186405?searchText=claude+ake&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dclaude%2Bake&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Adb8cff9ce18b99aaf62ec548e6fadf75),” the Nigerian political scientist Claude Ake attempted to formulate an African human rights system based on collective rights. According to Ake, the “Western notion of human rights” ignored the complexity of social and political challenges that African countries faced. For this reason, he considered it necessary to “extend the idea of human rights to include collective human rights for corporate social groups such as the family, the lineage, the ethnic group.” Therefore, the rights of an individual should be placed within a larger framework that he called “communal human rights.” His article provided important theoretical arguments for ACP policymakers negotiating Lomé IV with their European counterparts.

随着捐助者的不断坚持和非洲知识分子对人权学术贡献的不断增加，即将举行的洛美四世谈判成为截然不同的人权概念之间激烈理论辩论的关键场所之一。尼日利亚政治学家克劳德·阿克在其 1987 年的文章《非洲人权背景》中试图建立一个基于集体权利的非洲人权体系。阿克认为，“西方人权观念”忽视了非洲国家面临的社会和政治挑战的复杂性。为此，他认为有必要“将人权理念延伸到包括家庭、宗族、族群等企业社会群体的集体人权”。因此，个人的权利应该置于他所谓的“共同人权”的更大框架内。他的文章为非加太政策制定者与欧洲同行谈判洛美四号决议提供了重要的理论依据。

The debate exploded in December 1988 in Brussels, where the ACP-EEC Cultural Foundation held a conference titled “Human Dignity and the ACP/EEC Convention.” Throughout the event, ACP and European intellectuals wrestled over the supposed universality of human rights. The seminar was opened by the ACP Ambassador Raymond Chasle, who stressed the right of ACP States to pursue independent policies, potentially different from those of European partners. He warned against the risk of “[shutting oneself up […] in a universality that does not take account of specificities](https://archives.eui.eu/en/fonds/444511?item=AGE-556).” Chasle believed the ACP States needed to avoid adopting the [European hierarchy of values](http://aei.pitt.edu/39162/), which he identified with a radical individualism unsuited to the social reality of the developing world. In a similar vein, Isaac Nguema, President of the African Commission on Human Rights and Peoples’ Rights, [reflected](http://aei.pitt.edu/39165/) on the contentious issue of Universality and Specificities of Human Rights:

这场争论于 1988 年 12 月在布鲁塞尔爆发，当时 ACP-EEC 文化基金会在那里举办了一次题为“人类尊严与 ACP/EEC 公约”的会议。在整个活动中，非加太集团和欧洲知识分子就所谓的人权普遍性展开了争论。研讨会由非加太国家大使雷蒙德·查斯尔主持开幕，他强调非加太国家有权奉行独立政策，这些政策可能与欧洲伙伴的政策不同。他警告人们不要“将自己封闭在不考虑特殊性的普遍性中”。查斯尔认为，非加太国家需要避免采用欧洲的价值观等级制度，他认为这是一种不适合发展中国家社会现实的激进个人主义。同样，非洲人权和人民权利委员会主席艾萨克·恩圭马反思了人权的普遍性和特殊性这一有争议的问题：

> And how could our ancestral communities be led to have confidence in the pre-established rights enshrined in declarations largely inspired by the Western view of things? […] In this Africa, the individual’s only value is as part of his ethnic group. Outside that group, he is seen, and sees himself, as a slave, a beast, a bird, or a thing. He has no legal personality. […] The concept of the human person in Western thinking is an abstract, mechanical, static, and materialistic thing. A person’s only value depends on the part he plays in the economic production apparatus. […] The world must not be a collection of individuals. […] Feelings of solidarity and brotherhood […] are only some aspects of the African specificity which may be an inspiration for the building of a new universality of human rights, one that is open, dynamic, and humane.
> 
> 如何才能让我们的祖先社区对主要受西方事物观启发的宣言中所规定的既定权利充满信心？ [……]在这个非洲，个人的唯一价值是作为其种族群体的一部分。在这个群体之外，他被视为奴隶、野兽、鸟或其他东西。他没有法人资格。 [……]西方思想中的人的概念是一个抽象的、机械的、静态的、唯物主义的东西。一个人的唯一价值取决于他在经济生产装置中所扮演的角色。 [……]世界不能是个人的集合。 […]团结和兄弟情谊的感觉[…]只是非洲特性的某些方面，这可能会成为建立一种开放、充满活力和人道的新的普遍性人权的灵感。

Nguema strongly criticized the European approach to human rights, which he viewed as overly centered on the individual and protecting his civil and political rights against the intrusion of the State. To that, he contrasted the African concept of Human Rights, based on the importance of the community and the priority of collective rights over individual rights, which he viewed as capable of building a true Universality. Nguema’s argument was further endorsed by the President of the ACP Council of Ministers, Carl Greenidge. Greenidge stressed that the concept of human rights of the ACP countries was “no longer restricted to concern with freedom in a political sense” but viewed as equally important the promotion of socio-economic well-being respecting ACP’s [values, objectives, and priorities](http://aei.pitt.edu/39161/).

恩圭马强烈批评欧洲的人权做法，他认为这种做法过于以个人为中心，保护个人的公民权利和政治权利免受国家的侵犯。对此，他对比了非洲的人权概念，其基础是社区的重要性以及集体权利优先于个人权利，他认为这能够建立真正的普遍性。恩圭马的观点得到了非加太集团部长理事会主席卡尔·格林尼奇的进一步认可。格林尼奇强调，非加太国家的人权概念“不再局限于政治意义上的自由”，而是认为促进社会经济福祉与尊重非加太国家的价值观、目标和优先事项同样重要。

The European side argued for adopting a notion of Human Rights based on political and economic democracy, as well as prioritizing civil and political rights of the individual over collective rights. During the conference, the French professor of International Relations [Pierre Weiss](http://aei.pitt.edu/39161/) insisted on the superiority of parliamentary democracy modeled after Europe, which he presented as the political system most conducive to the respect of human rights. In a similar vein, the Belgian financial advisor [Bernard Snoy](http://aei.pitt.edu/39161/) argued that adopting a free-market economy was inseparable from respecting human rights and democracy. The position of European scholars was aptly summarized by the Director General for Development at the EEC Commission, [Dieter Frisch](http://aei.pitt.edu/39161/), whose final speech emphasized the importance of respecting the “personality and freedom of the individual and of groups.”

欧洲方面主张采用基于政治和经济民主的人权概念，并将个人的公民权利和政治权利置于集体权利之上。会议期间，法国国际关系学教授皮埃尔·韦斯坚称欧洲议会民主制的优越性，认为这是最有利于尊重人权的政治制度。同样，比利时金融顾问伯纳德·斯诺伊认为，采用自由市场经济与尊重人权和民主密不可分。欧洲经济共同体委员会发展事务总干事迪特尔·弗里施（Dieter Frisch）恰当地总结了欧洲学者的立场，他的最后讲话强调了尊重“个人和群体的个性和自由”的重要性。

The disagreement between African and European scholars largely stemmed from the fear of the former that Lomé may be used to impose the European socio-political model on the ACP Countries. This concern had characterized debates about Lomé from the outset in the late 1970s. In a retrospective analysis of the Lomé IV debate, the Ugandan political scientist [J. Barya](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1759-5436.1993.mp24001004.x) accused the EEC countries and other Western donors of exercising a form of “moral colonialism” on developing countries. According to Barya and many other African intellectuals, the human rights discourse turned out to be an [imperialistic tool](https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Concept_of_Human_Rights_in_Africa.html?id=cdJ5QR2GvQMC&redir_esc=y) whose true objective was [the eradication of socialism](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43657804) and the imposition of neo-liberal economic policies. Authors like [Samir Amin](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43657804) and [Issa Shivji](https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Concept_of_Human_Rights_in_Africa.html?id=cdJ5QR2GvQMC&redir_esc=y), in the same vein as Nguema, insisted on considering African specificities and called for the creation of an [African concept of democracy](https://www.brookings.edu/book/democracy-and-development-in-africa/), more suited to local reality and based on more authentic participation of the people.

非洲和欧洲学者之间的分歧很大程度上源于非洲学者担心洛美可能被用来将欧洲社会政治模式强加给非加太国家。从 20 世纪 70 年代末开始，这种担忧就成为了有关洛美的争论的特征。在对洛美四次辩论的回顾性分析中，乌干达政治学家巴亚指责欧共体国家和其他西方捐助者对发展中国家实行某种形式的“道德殖民主义”。巴里亚和许多其他非洲知识分子认为，人权话语实际上是帝国主义的工具，其真正目标是消灭社会主义和实施新自由主义经济政策。萨米尔·阿明和伊萨·希夫吉等作家与恩圭马一样，坚持考虑非洲的具体情况，呼吁创造一种更适合当地实际、基于人民更真实参与的非洲民主概念。

The controversy around the definition of human rights profoundly affected the negotiations of the Lomé IV Convention. Following the end of the Cold War, the EEC was able to take advantage of the changing international system and exert significant pressure on the ACP States. Simultaneously, the EEC could not push the human rights issue too far, as the ACP countries opposed any form of political conditionality. Lastly, the European Community did not wish to jeopardize Lomé, which it considered a significant accomplishment in its external policy towards developing countries.

围绕人权定义的争议深刻影响了《洛美四号公约》的谈判。冷战结束后，欧洲经济共同体能够利用不断变化的国际体系，对非加太国家施加巨大压力。同时，欧洲经济共同体不能将人权问题推得太远，因为非加太国家反对任何形式的政治条件。最后，欧洲共同体不希望危及洛美，它认为洛美是其针对发展中国家的对外政策的一项重大成就。

At the signing of the Lomé IV Convention in December 1989, the parties reached a compromise between the differing conceptions of human rights among EEC and ACP intellectuals. Human rights were finally included in [the main text of the Convention](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/75c76a39-a551-4908-8289-da2051b1efc2), with Article 5 dedicated exclusively to them. Article 5 established that development must be centered on [man](https://edit.wti.org/app.php/document/show/ba140599-d4ec-4153-a4f0-8a1ad402021b), which necessarily entailed “respect for and promotion of all human rights.” Simultaneously, human rights were considered indivisible and interrelated, comprising both individual and collective rights, and became a prerequisite for development as well as one of the essential elements of the Convention.

1989年12月签署《洛美四世公约》时，各方在欧共体和非加太知识分子之间不同的人权观念之间达成了妥协。人权最终被纳入《公约》正文，其中第 5 条专门针对人权。第五条规定，发展必须以人为中心，这必然意味着“尊重和促进一切人权”。同时，人权被认为是不可分割和相互关联的，包括个人权利和集体权利，并成为发展的先决条件以及《公约》的基本要素之一。

Article 5 gave equal importance to individual and collective rights and, for the first time explicitly, mentioned the right to development as a priority for the ACP States. Another success for the ACP Countries was the absence of any reference to democracy from Lomé IV, which they would have perceived as an attempt to “westernize” their political systems. As a result, many ACP intellectuals welcomed Article 5 as a viable compromise between the priorities of the EEC and the ACP Countries. For instance, the Senegalese jurist [Keba Mbaye](https://www.icj.org/les-droits-de-lhomme-en-afrique/) believed Lomé IV provisions regarding human rights were a crucial passage in the coupling of development and human rights:

第五条同等重视个人权利和集体权利，并首次明确提到发展权是非加太国家的优先事项。非加太国家的另一个成功是洛美四世没有提及民主，他们认为这是试图“西化”其政治制度。因此，许多 ACP 知识分子对第 5 条表示欢迎，认为这是 EEC 和 ACP 国家优先事项之间可行的妥协。例如，塞内加尔法学家凯巴·姆巴耶（Keba Mbaye）认为，洛美四世关于人权的条款是发展与人权耦合的关键环节：

> We can say that Lomé IV postulates that development requires respect for human rights. […] Human dignity and human rights are posed as an aspiration for both individuals and peoples. This formula shows that the ACP countries and the EC do not distinguish between Human Rights and People’s Rights. […] It also seems important to me to emphasize once again that the Lomé IV Convention poses, for the first time in a treaty of this type, the problem of the right to development.
> 
> 可以说，洛美四世提出发展需要尊重人权。 [……]人的尊严和人权是个人和人民的愿望。这个公式表明，非加太国家和欧共体并不区分人权和人民权利。 [……]对我来说，再次强调《洛美第四公约》在此类条约中首次提出发展权问题似乎也很重要。

Ironically, the Lomé IV debate over human rights opened the path for a progressive erosion of the ACP negotiating power in the Lomé context. In the following years, European officials began advancing [a universal scale of values of Human Dignity](http://aei.pitt.edu/39174/), which considered human rights independent from culture or religion. In 1993, after a prolonged discussion, the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly, the parliamentary body of Lomé, adopted a report and a resolution on Human Rights and Democracy in the ACP States. Despite acknowledging the Lomé IV compromise on the definition of Human Rights, the resolution formally included the notion of a “multi-party democracy” in cooperation between the ACP and the EEC, which took the political systems of Western Europe as a model for the ACP Countries. Further, the resolution considered [civil and political rights as independent from the level of economic development](http://aei.pitt.edu/39184/), thus prioritizing them over social and economic rights.

具有讽刺意味的是，洛美四次关于人权的辩论为非加太集团在洛美背景下谈判能力的逐步削弱开辟了道路。在接下来的几年里，欧洲官员开始推进人类尊严的普遍价值观，认为人权独立于文化或宗教。 1993年，经过长时间的讨论，洛美议会机构非加太-欧共体联合大会通过了一份关于非加太国家人权与民主的报告和决议。尽管承认洛美四世在人权定义上的妥协，但该决议正式纳入了非加太集团与欧洲经济共同体合作的“多党民主”概念，该概念以西欧政治制度为非加太集团的模式国家。此外，该决议认为公民权利和政治权利独立于经济发展水平，因此优先于社会和经济权利。

From a theoretical point of view, Article 5 was a successful compromise between two contrasting views on human rights and development. During the Lomé IV debate, scholars from Africa and Europe discussed issues previously considered political taboo. As a result, they reached a novel, creative conclusion accommodating non-Western values and norms into a binding international agreement, creating an exception to what African scholars in the early 1990s called European [ethnocentrism](http://aei.pitt.edu/39174/). Thus, the years between 1988 and 1991 represent a unique example of a compromise between developed and developing countries regarding a viable and practical understanding of human rights. Further, Article 5 of Lomé IV anticipated the compromise reached at the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights between Western and developing countries when [the right to development was included and equal importance was given to the various categories of rights](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/183139).

从理论角度来看，第五条是关于人权和发展的两种截然不同的观点之间的成功妥协。在洛美四世辩论期间，来自非洲和欧洲的学者讨论了以前被视为政治禁忌的问题。结果，他们得出了一个新颖的、创造性的结论，将非西方价值观和规范纳入具有约束力的国际协议，为 20 世纪 90 年代初非洲学者所说的欧洲民族中心主义创造了一个例外。因此，1988年至1991年是发达国家和发展中国家在对人权的可行和实际理解方面达成妥协的独特例子。此外，《洛美四世》第五条预见了西方国家和发展中国家在1993年维也纳世界人权会议上达成的妥协，其中纳入了发展权，并对各类权利给予同等重视。

The Lomé IV debate touched upon some of the most critical political issues of the late 20th century. What began as a disagreement regarding the nature of human rights resulted in a stimulating example of cooperation between intellectuals from developed and developing countries. As a result, studying Lomé provides crucial insights into our present understanding of key terms of international politics: such as human rights, development, or political conditionality. The Lomé IV debate proves that the theoretical contributions of African scholars to international law are permanent – and can still be inspiring today.

洛美四世辩论触及 20 世纪末一些最关键的政治问题。最初关于人权本质的分歧后来成为发达国家和发展中国家知识分子之间合作的一个激动人心的例子。因此，研究洛美为我们目前对国际政治关键术语的理解提供了重要的见解：例如人权、发展或政治条件。洛美四次辩论证明，非洲学者对国际法的理论贡献是永久性的 — — 并且在今天仍然具有启发性。
