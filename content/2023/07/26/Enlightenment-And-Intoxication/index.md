*If there's a price upon my head,*

*如果我的头上有一个价格，*

*So what? It's only I*

*所以呢？只有我一个人*

*Who, lying drunk at dawn,*

*谁在黎明醉酒地躺着，*

*Have claimed the yellow sky.*

*已经占领了黄色的天空。*

— Li Bai, the wine-loving poet of China

——李白，中国热爱葡萄酒的诗人

Timothy Leary being arrested shortly after President Nixon called him ‘the most dangerous man in America.’

尼克松总统称蒂莫西·利里为“美国最危险的人”后不久，蒂莫西·利里就被捕了。

The obvious path to spiritual development is through health and well-being, do as the plants say, live well, eat right, treat your body with respect and allow your spirit to be aligned with nature, free from any intoxicating substances that may interfere with the purity of your being. This is the sensible way, but it is not the only way.

精神发展的明显途径是通过健康和福祉，按照植物所说的去做，好好生活，正确饮食，尊重你的身体，让你的精神与自然保持一致，远离任何可能干扰的令人陶醉的物质。你存在的纯洁性。这是明智的做法，但不是唯一的做法。

Throughout history, small pockets of spiritual degenerates, drunks and drug users have tried a different approach. Rather than the ascetic who removes himself from society, spending his days in contemplation up a mountainside free from all temptation, there are those who have gone looking for god, not in solitude, but in the gutter, through a drunken haze and the physical strain of a body pushed to the mind splintering heights of intoxication.

纵观历史，一小部分精神堕落者、酒鬼和吸毒者尝试过不同的方法。与那些远离社会、在远离一切诱惑的山腰上度过终日沉思的苦行者不同，有些人不是在孤独中，而是在阴沟里，通过醉酒的迷雾和身体的紧张来寻找上帝。身体被推向精神分裂的陶醉高度。

Every civilisation in human history has used some form of mind-altering substance. The earliest evidence of alcohol consumption dates back to the Neolithic period (c. 10,000 BC). We've been getting wasted since the stone age. With some anthropologists speculating that the consumption of fermented fruit, leading to its intentional fermentation, could go back as far as 10 million years.

人类历史上的每一个文明都使用过某种形式的改变思想的物质。饮酒的最早证据可以追溯到新石器时代（约公元前 10,000 年）。从石器时代开始，我们就一直在浪费。一些人类学家推测，食用发酵水果导致其有意发酵的历史可以追溯到 1000 万年前。

Cannabis was considered medicinal in ancient China and was used by Emperor Shen Nung (c. 2737 BC). He is credited with writing a pharmacopoeia on herbal plants that included cannabis, which was recommended to treat conditions such as rheumatism, malaria, and absent-mindedness. It also cautioned against excessive use, warning that it could cause one to "see demons."

大麻在中国古代被认为具有药用价值，并被神农皇帝（约公元前 2737 年）使用。他因撰写了一部关于包括大麻在内的草药植物的药典而受到赞誉，该药典被推荐用于治疗风湿病、疟疾和心不在焉等疾病。它还警告不要过度使用，警告它可能会导致人们“看到恶魔”。

In ancient Greece at the birth point of the modern world, in the golden age of intellectual and cultural progress, there were a series of secret rituals, celebrations, and initiations held annually in the city of Eleusis, near Athens, called the Eleusinian Mysteries. The mysteries began in the Mycenaean period (circa 1600 BC to 1100 BC) and continued for nearly two thousand years until they were suppressed by the Christian Roman Emperor.

在现代世界的诞生点古希腊，在知识和文化进步的黄金时代，每年在雅典附近的埃琉西斯城举行一系列秘密仪式、庆祝活动和入会仪式，称为埃琉西斯神秘仪式。这些神秘事件始于迈锡尼时期（约公元前1600年至公元前1100年），持续了近两千多年，直到被基督教罗马皇帝镇压。

During the rites, participants consumed a psychoactive drink called kykeon. Most Greek religious practices were segregated by gender and social status but this practice was open to all Greek-speaking people, men and women, free and enslaved.

在仪式期间，参与者饮用了一种名为 kykeon 的精神活性饮料。大多数希腊宗教活动都按性别和社会地位进行隔离，但这种活动向所有说希腊语的人开放，无论男女、自由人和奴隶。

Plato and Cicero, among many other notable figures, attended the ceremonies. Plato mentioned the Eleusinian Mysteries in his writings several times though never revealed their secrets. Cicero praised the mysteries for their role in shaping personal morality and civilization at large.

柏拉图和西塞罗等许多著名人物出席了这些仪式。柏拉图在他的著作中多次提到厄琉西斯之谜，但从未透露过它们的秘密。西塞罗赞扬这些神秘事物在塑造个人道德和整个文明方面所发挥的作用。

Psychedelics have been used in spiritual practices since the dawn of humanity and will be used by a wider audience thanks to the current burgeoning psychedelic renaissance and the brilliant work of people like [MAPS](https://maps.org/), but what about that far uglier and hazardous of substances: alcohol? Is there any redemptive spiritual function in a drug that, when consumed recklessly enough, can turn the most self-disciplined of men into feral children?

自人类诞生之日起，迷幻剂就被用于精神实践，并且由于当前蓬勃发展的迷幻剂复兴和 MAPS 等人的出色工作，迷幻剂将被更广泛的受众使用，但是更丑陋和危险的物质：酒精呢？如果一种药物有任何救赎的精神功能，当它不顾一切地服用时，可以将最自律的男人变成野孩子吗？

It feels good to disclose our vices, to share how we soften the edges of reality and ease our anxieties, to mutually acknowledge our flaws and coping strategies. Sometimes people need a vice, even if that vice is a pathological commitment to fitness. I’m a little wary of people who seem to be squeaky clean. Surely they have a vice so dark it cannot be shared in polite society. A truly terrifying individual.

揭露我们的恶习，分享我们如何软化现实的边缘，缓解我们的焦虑，相互承认我们的缺陷和应对策略，感觉很好。有时人们需要一种恶习，即使这种恶习是对健康的病态承诺。我对那些看起来干净整洁的人有点警惕。当然，他们有一个如此黑暗的恶习，在上流社会中是无法分享的。一个真正可怕的人。

When the sun is out and you're feeling great, life itself is intoxicating. And maybe this is how life once was for small tribes of people fortunate enough to live in paradise, French Polynesia perhaps, where they would hunt pigs under the tropic sun by day and build fires at night, eating, drinking, dancing, and lying together until the sun came up when they would do it all over again. I wonder how long we lived in this perfect world, if it ever existed at all.

当太阳出来并且你感觉很棒时，生活本身就是令人陶醉的。也许这就是幸运地生活在天堂（也许是法属波利尼西亚）的小部落的生活，他们白天在热带阳光下打猪，晚上生火，一起吃、喝、跳舞、躺着。直到太阳升起，他们又会重来一遍。我想知道我们在这个完美的世界里生活了多久，如果它曾经存在的话。

It’s an unrealistic ideal, but somewhere out there the good life goes on. Unfortunately, I grew up in Scotland in the 90s where drunken insanity was the flavour of the day. A flavour that persists unimpeded as it has done for generations. It taught me many things and provided endless examples of fascinating degenerates. There is something so compelling about those who stagger and sway down a more unorthodox path.

这是一个不切实际的理想，但美好的生活仍在继续。不幸的是，我在 20 世纪 90 年代的苏格兰长大，那时候醉酒疯狂是当时的主流。一种世代相传、畅通无阻的味道。它教会了我很多东西，并提供了无数令人着迷的堕落例子。那些在非正统道路上蹒跚前行的人有一种非常引人注目的特质。

*Wildly singing I waited for the moon,

狂歌我等待月亮，

And my shadow danced with me because I was drunk.* — Li Bai

我的影子和我一起跳舞，因为我喝醉了。 ——李白

In Taoism, over the centuries, there have been several sects and practitioners that have deviated away from the usual ascetic practices and into more drunken (often sex-crazed) territory.

在道教中，几个世纪以来，有几个教派和修行者已经偏离了通常的苦行修行，进入了更加醉酒（通常是性疯狂）的领域。

Li Bai, (also known as Li Po) a renowned poet of the Tang Dynasty was often depicted as a drunken sage who wrote about wine and celebrated being in a magical state of drunkenness. For him, alcohol was a spiritual tool that could help transcend the mundane world. The legend goes that he drowned trying to embrace the moon's reflection in a lake whilst inebriated. So it goes, my friend.

李白（又名李白），唐代著名诗人，经常被描绘成醉圣人，写酒，颂扬醉酒的神奇状态。对他来说，酒精是一种可以帮助超越世俗的精神工具。传说他在喝醉时试图拥抱湖中的月亮倒影而溺水身亡。就这样吧，我的朋友。

*……陈王在圆满宫的宴会上付钱*

*Ten thousand coins for a cask of wine, with many a laugh and quip.*

*一桶酒一万钱，笑声和俏皮话不少。*

*Why say, my host, that your money is gone?*

*主人，为什么说你的钱没了？*

*Go and buy wine and we'll drink it together!*

*去买酒，我们一起喝吧！*

*My flower-dappled horse,*  

*我的花斑马，*

*My furs worth a thousand,*

*我的皮毛价值一千，*

*Hand them to the boy to exchange for good wine,*

*递给少年换好酒，*

*And we'll drown away the woes of ten thousand generations!*

*我们将淹没万代人的苦难！*

— Li Bai, *Bringing The Wine*

——李白《端酒》

We don't think of alcohol as a spiritual substance (for obvious cultural reasons but also) because being drunk can feel so profoundly unspiritual. Li Bai's poetry embodies a particular flavour of intoxication. He is wistful and full of longing, sorrowful and yet in love with life itself. The New Yorker said his 'poems are filled with reunions and partings, rapture and sorrow, and they tend to suggest that we are alone and lost in the world.' He drinks to enhance the pleasures of the world.

我们不认为酒精是一种精神物质（出于明显的文化原因），因为喝醉会让人感觉非常不精神。李白的诗有一种特殊的沉醉的味道。他充满渴望，充满渴望，悲伤，却热爱生活本身。 《纽约客》说，他的“诗充满了团聚和离别、狂喜和悲伤，它们往往暗示我们在世界上孤独和迷失。”他喝酒是为了增加世间的乐趣。

This is the lighter side of alcoholism, the melancholy dance, deeply engaged with the loving sadness of it all. But any love letter to drink and drugs must contain its unpleasant opposite. It is possible to live as Li Bai did, in that elevated state of euphoric liberation, wildly in love with life, but one must acknowledge its inherently destructive allure.

这是酗酒的轻松的一面，忧郁的舞蹈，深深地融入了这一切的爱的悲伤。但任何关于酗酒和吸毒的情书都必须包含其令人不快的反面。我们可以像李白那样生活，处于一种欣快的解放状态，疯狂地热爱生活，但我们必须承认它与生俱来的破坏性诱惑。

Ultimately, our lives demand balance. For those of us who spent the first half of our lives courting chaos, perhaps our later years will be dedicated to cultivating peace. Or perhaps we will rage into the grave, used up, burnt out, and totally insane.

最终，我们的生活需要平衡。对于我们这些前半生忙于制造混乱的人来说，也许我们的晚年将致力于培养和平。或者，我们可能会愤怒地进入坟墓，筋疲力尽、精疲力竭，彻底疯狂。
