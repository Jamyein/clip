原标题：4 Psychological Reasons You Feel Anxious All the Time - Nick Wignall

If you struggle with anxiety, you’ve probably heard the usual advice:  
如果你在焦虑中挣扎，你可能听说过通常的建议：

-   *You just need to relax and loosen up a little.  
    你只需要放松一下，放松一下。*
-   *Stop worrying and try to appreciate all the good things in your life.  
    停止担心，试着欣赏生活中所有的美好事物。*
-   *Try to live more in the moment.  
    试着活在当下。*

And while well-intentioned, advice like this is awfully simplistic… If being less anxious were as simple as making a decision to loosen up, no one would be anxious!  
虽然用心良苦，但这样的建议过于简单化......如果不那么焦虑就像做出放松的决定一样简单，没有人会焦虑！

What most people don’t realize is this:  
大多数人没有意识到的是：

**There are often subtle psychological reasons why we get stuck feeling anxious.  
通常有微妙的心理原因导致我们感到焦虑。**

In my work as a psychologist, I help my clients to understand the core mechanisms driving anxiety in the first place.  
在我作为心理学家的工作中，我首先帮助我的客户了解驱动焦虑的核心机制。

Because when you understand the real causes of your anxiety it’s a lot easier to move past it for good.  
因为当你了解焦虑的真正原因时，就更容易永远克服它。

## 1\. You have a low tolerance for uncertainty  
1\. 你对不确定性的容忍度很低

Feeling uncertain can be anxiety-producing, especially when it comes to things that really matter to us:  
感到不确定可能会产生焦虑，尤其是当涉及到对我们真正重要的事情时：

-   *Should I take that new exciting job or stick with my boring but safe one?  
    我应该接受这份令人兴奋的新工作，还是坚持我无聊但安全的工作？*
-   *I like her but do I really love her enough to get married?  
    我喜欢她，但我真的爱她到结婚的程度吗？*
-   *Should I tell my boyfriend how unhappy I am with our sex life or not?  
    我应该告诉我的男朋友我对我们的性生活有多不满意吗？*

But even in relatively small things, uncertainty can still produce some anxiety:  
但即使在相对较小的事情上，不确定性仍然会产生一些焦虑：

-   *Should I take the freeway or side streets?  
    我应该走高速公路还是小街？*
-   *Mystery or Rom-Com for movie night?  
    电影之夜的神秘或浪漫喜剧？*
-   *Make lasagna or order take-out?  
    制作千层面或点外卖？*

And because the anxiety of uncertainty feels so uncomfortable, our natural instinct is to do something to make it go away.  
由于不确定的焦虑让人感到非常不舒服，我们的自然本能是做点什么让它消失。

For example: 例如：

-   Suppose you’re uncertain about whether to stay in your job and quit. Even though you’ve done all your research, talked to key advisers, and given yourself plenty of time to think it through, you still feel uncertain—and as a result, anxious.  
    假设你不确定是否要继续工作并辞职。即使你已经完成了所有的研究，与主要顾问交谈，并给了自己足够的时间来思考，你仍然感到不确定 - 因此，焦虑。
-   But you’ve decided you’re going to quit. So, you start typing out your resignation notice. But as you get to the final sentence, you feel a surge of anxiety! So you instinctively pick up the phone and call your spouse to check with them to make sure you’re doing the right thing.  
    但你已经决定要退出。所以，你开始输入你的辞职通知。但是当你说到最后一句话时，你会感到一阵焦虑！所以你本能地拿起电话，打电话给你的配偶，与他们核实，以确保你做的是正确的。
-   Your spouse reassures you, you feel less anxious, and you proceed to quit your job.  
    你的配偶让你放心，你感到不那么焦虑，然后你继续辞职。

The problem here is that even though “checking in” with your spouse gave you some relief from your anxiety in the short term, it’s done something far worse in the long term…  
这里的问题是，尽管与配偶“签到”在短期内让你从焦虑中得到一些缓解，但从长远来看，它却做了一些更糟糕的事情......

**When you use reassurance to escape uncertainty, you teach your brain to fear uncertainty and the anxiety that goes with it.  
当你用安慰来逃避不确定性时，你教会你的大脑害怕不确定性和随之而来的焦虑。**

This means that the next time you feel uncertain, your brain is going to make you feel even more anxious about feeling uncertain. And this will lead to an even stronger impulse to avoid the uncertainty by seeking reassurance.  
这意味着下次你感到不确定时，你的大脑会让你对不确定的感觉感到更加焦虑。这将导致更强烈的冲动，通过寻求保证来避免不确定性。

See where this vicious cycle is headed?  
看看这个恶性循环将走向何方？

**When your tolerance for uncertainty is low, your long-term anxiety will be high.  
当你对不确定性的容忍度很低时，你的长期焦虑就会很高。**

On the other hand…  
另一方面。。。

**If you want to decrease your anxiety in the long-term, you must be willing to tolerate it in the short-term.  
如果你想长期减少焦虑，你必须愿意在短期内忍受它。**

When you face up to your uncertainty and all the anxiety that goes with it—accepting it instead of trying to get rid of it—you teach your brain that, while uncomfortable, uncertainty itself isn’t dangerous.  
当你面对你的不确定性和随之而来的所有焦虑——接受它而不是试图摆脱它——你教会你的大脑，虽然不舒服，但不确定性本身并不危险。

Do that enough and your confidence in your ability to tolerate that uncertainty will grow. And as your confidence grows, your anxiety will shrink.  
这样做足够多，你对自己容忍这种不确定性的能力的信心就会增加。随着你信心的增长，你的焦虑也会缩小。

**You don’t have to like uncertainty. But if you want to feel less anxious, you need to learn to live with it instead of always trying to escape it.  
你不必喜欢不确定性。但是，如果你想感到不那么焦虑，你需要学会忍受它，而不是总是试图逃避它。**

## 2\. You have a high need for control  
2\. 你对控制有很高的需求

Obviously, our ability to control things in life is a good thing…  
显然，我们控制生活中事物的能力是一件好事......

-   Being able to lower your blood pressure by exercising regularly is a useful form of control over your health.  
    能够通过定期锻炼来降低血压是控制健康的有用形式。
-   Being able to decline a second date with that creepy guy is a useful form of control over your social life.  
    能够拒绝与那个令人毛骨悚然的家伙的第二次约会是对你社交生活的一种有用的控制形式。
-   Being able to choose vanilla vs chocolate ice-cream is a nice form of control 🙂  
    能够选择香草与巧克力冰淇淋是一种很好的控制🙂形式

But like so many things in life, appearances can be deceiving…  
但就像生活中的许多事情一样，外表可能是骗人的......

**Just because the ability to exert control is often helpful doesn’t mean it’s always helpful.  
仅仅因为施加控制的能力通常是有帮助的并不意味着它总是有帮助的。**

And in fact, in certain situations, trying to exert control can actually backfire—sometimes spectacularly so!  
事实上，在某些情况下，试图施加控制实际上会适得其反——有时甚至会适得其反！

A few examples of unhelpful attempts at control:  
一些无益的控制尝试的例子：

-   **Badgering your spouse about how they really need to get into therapy to take care of their anger issues.** Each time you do it, their odds of going to therapy decrease and the odds of them resenting you increase (along with your frustration and anxiety).  
    纠缠你的配偶，告诉他们如何真正需要接受治疗来照顾他们的愤怒问题。每次你这样做，他们接受治疗的几率都会降低，他们怨恨你的几率也会增加（伴随着你的沮丧和焦虑）。
-   **Trying hard to make yourself fall asleep.** Trying hard to do anything increases your levels of arousal, which directly inhibits your ability to fall asleep. And when you don’t sleep well, you’re far more prone to anxiety.  
    努力让自己入睡。努力做任何事情都会增加你的唤醒水平，这直接抑制了你入睡的能力。当你睡不好时，你更容易焦虑。
-   **Wait up all night worrying about all the worst-case scenarios for your teenage son making a bad decision at that party.** Not only will you be an anxious wreck, but worrying won’t actually change your kid’s decision-making.  
    整夜等待，担心你十几岁的儿子在那次聚会上做出错误决定的所有最坏情况。你不仅会成为一个焦虑的残骸，而且担心实际上不会改变你孩子的决策。

*But why do I keep doing it? Why do I keep trying to control things even though I know I can’t?  
但是我为什么要一直这样做呢？为什么即使我知道我不能，我仍然试图控制事情？*

Here’s how it usually works:  
以下是它通常的工作原理：

-   When faced with things outside our control, it’s natural to feel helpless.  
    当面对我们无法控制的事情时，自然会感到无助。
-   And in the very short-term, exerting control (however useless) feels good—it makes you feel in control and distracts you from that painful feeling of helplessness.  
    在非常短期内，施加控制（无论多么无用）感觉很好——它会让你感到掌控，并分散你对那种痛苦的无助感的注意力。
-   Of course like any pain killer, the benefit is only temporary. Which means you’ll still be left with your helplessness in the end—along with the natural levels of anxiety and stress that go along with problem-solving and exerting control.  
    当然，像任何止痛药一样，好处只是暂时的。这意味着你最终仍然会留下你的无助——以及伴随着解决问题和控制的自然水平的焦虑和压力。

**If you want to lower your anxiety for good, stop living in denial about your ability to control things you can’t.  
如果你想永远降低你的焦虑，就不要再否认你有能力控制你无法控制的事情。**

Work to accept that bad things happen, helplessness is inevitable sometimes, and that trying to control the uncontrollable only makes things worse in the end.  
努力接受坏事的发生，有时无助是不可避免的，试图控制无法控制的事情最终只会让事情变得更糟。

Feeling helpless is hard enough… Why make yourself anxious too?  
感到无助已经够难的了...为什么要让自己也焦虑？

## 3\. You try to manage your stress instead of your stressors  
3.你试图管理你的压力而不是你的压力源

I think most people realize that [chronic stress](https://nickwignall.com/stressed-out/) is a major contributor to anxiety…  
我想大多数人都意识到慢性压力是焦虑的主要原因......

-   If you’re constantly overwhelmed at work, you’re probably going to be pretty anxious too.  
    如果你在工作中经常不知所措，你可能也会非常焦虑。
-   If you’re in an unhealthy and stressful relationship, you’re gonna have a lot of anxiety along with it.  
    如果你处于一段不健康和压力大的关系中，你会有很多焦虑。
-   If you’re the primary caregiver for an aging and ill parent—one of the most stressful jobs there is—it’s natural to feel some anxiety as well.  
    如果您是年迈和生病的父母的主要照顾者 - 这是压力最大的工作之一 - 自然也会感到焦虑。

But what most people don’t realize is that the common advance to manage your stress is actually a [pretty terrible idea](https://nickwignall.com/stressor-management/).  
但大多数人没有意识到的是，管理压力的共同进步实际上是一个非常糟糕的想法。

*Wait, you’re a psychologist and you’re telling me that stress management is a bad thing?  
等等，你是一名心理学家，你告诉我压力管理是一件坏事？*

For the most part, yes. And the reason comes down to a simple but crucial distinction between *stress* and *stressors*.  
在大多数情况下，是的。原因归结为压力和压力源之间简单但关键的区别。

Stress, or being stressed, is a physical reaction to a stressor:  
压力或被压力是对压力源的身体反应：

-   Your boss sending a passive-aggressive email is a *stressor*; your shoulders tensing up in response is *stress*.  
    您的老板发送被动攻击性电子邮件是一种压力源;你的肩膀绷紧是压力。
-   Your spouse making a sarcastic comment after dinner is a *stressor*; feeling inadequate and insecure for hours after the fact is *stress*.  
    你的配偶在晚餐后发表讽刺评论是一种压力源;事后数小时感到不足和不安全是压力。

**Most people spend so much time trying to manage their stress that they end up ignoring the real problem—the constant stream of stressors in their lives!  
大多数人花了很多时间试图管理他们的压力，以至于他们最终忽略了真正的问题——生活中源源不断的压力源！**

Of course, sometimes it’s literally impossible to change the stressors in your life. If you’re a soldier on the battlefield, you’re not going to have much luck convincing opposing soldiers to stop stressing you out so much.  
当然，有时几乎不可能改变生活中的压力源。如果你是战场上的士兵，你不会有太多的运气说服对方士兵停止给你带来太大的压力。

But most of us, in most aspects of our lives, have more control over our stressors than we think…  
但是我们大多数人，在我们生活的大部分方面，对压力源的控制比我们想象的要多......

For example, many people end up believing that rude or toxic people in their lives are an inevitable stressor that will never change. And as a result, all they can do is try to manage their own stress—do more meditation, think positive, etc.  
例如，许多人最终认为他们生活中粗鲁或有毒的人是不可避免的压力源，永远不会改变。因此，他们所能做的就是尝试管理自己的压力——做更多的冥想，积极思考，等等。

But here’s the thing… I don’t care how much [mindfulness meditation](https://nickwignall.com/how-to-start-a-mindfulness-practice/) you practice, if you’re surrounded by jerks who demean you all the time, you’re going to feel pretty anxious!  
但事情是这样的...我不在乎你练习了多少正念冥想，如果你周围都是一直贬低你的混蛋，你会感到非常焦虑！

Unfortunately, because of the cult of stress management, people end up believing that they’re the problem—*If only I thought more positively, I wouldn’t be so stressed and anxious…*  
不幸的是，由于对压力管理的崇拜，人们最终相信他们就是问题所在——如果我能更积极地思考，我就不会那么紧张和焦虑......

Bullshit.

You don’t need more breathing exercises, positive mantras, or any other fad stress management techniques. What you really need is to quit obsessing about your stress and start focusing on how you can manage your stressors.  
你不需要更多的呼吸练习、积极的咒语或任何其他时尚的压力管理技巧。你真正需要的是停止沉迷于你的压力，开始专注于如何管理你的压力源。

And 99% of the time, better [stressor management](https://nickwignall.com/stressor-management/) (and less anxiety) comes down to being more assertive:  
99%的情况下，更好的压力源管理（和更少的焦虑）归结为更加自信：

-   Difficult as it may be, setting and enforcing healthy boundaries with your passive-aggressive spouse is going to do a lot more for your anxiety than trying to change your self-talk.  
    尽管可能很困难，但与被动攻击型配偶设定和执行健康的界限将比试图改变你的自我对话对你的焦虑更有帮助。
-   Having an honest and respectful conversation with your manager about your workload is going to reduce your anxiety a lot more than deep breathing exercises before meetings.  
    与你的经理就你的工作量进行诚实和尊重的对话，比在会议前进行深呼吸练习更能减少你的焦虑。
-   Consistently implementing (and sticking to) clear rules and consequences with your teenagers is going to do a lot more for your chronic worry and anxiety than a new brand of CBD gummies.  
    与青少年一起始终如一地实施（并坚持）明确的规则和后果，将比新品牌的 CBD 软糖对您的长期担忧和焦虑做更多的事情。

In short: 总之：

**If you want to reduce your anxiety, stop relying on stress management to treat the symptoms and address the source by managing your stressors assertively.  
如果你想减少你的焦虑，停止依赖压力管理来治疗症状，并通过果断地管理你的压力源来解决源头。**

## 4\. You’re a People-Pleaser  
4.你是一个讨人喜欢的人

Most people hate conflict.  
大多数人讨厌冲突。

In fact, they’re so afraid of conflict that they’ll do some pretty extreme things to avoid it…  
事实上，他们非常害怕冲突，以至于他们会做一些非常极端的事情来避免冲突......

-   I had a client once who went along with her husband’s request for a divorce because she didn’t want to make him feel bad by explaining what she really wanted from him in their sexual life.  
    我曾经有一个客户，她同意她丈夫的离婚要求，因为她不想通过解释她在性生活中真正想要从他那里得到什么来让他感到难过。
-   Then there was the guy who put up was so afraid of upsetting his boss that he routinely worked 60 hour weeks (instead of 40) and frequently missed major family events like birthday parties and recitals.  
    还有一个人非常害怕惹老板不高兴，以至于他经常每周工作60小时（而不是40小时），并且经常错过生日聚会和独奏会等重大家庭活动。

But of course, people-pleasing shows up in all sorts of small ways too:  
但是，当然，取悦人们也以各种小方式出现：

-   Always “going with the flow” and agreeing to whatever movie your spouse wants to watch.  
    总是“顺其自然”，同意你的配偶想看的任何电影。
-   Holding back a piece of valuable criticism from a coworker because you don’t want them to feel bad.  
    阻止同事的宝贵批评，因为你不希望他们感到难过。

Regardless of the details, here’s the thing about people-pleasing:  
无论细节如何，以下是关于取悦人的事情：

**When you habitually prioritize other people at the expense of yourself, you teach your mind that you’re not important.  
当你习惯性地以牺牲自己为代价来优先考虑别人时，你就会教会你的头脑你并不重要。**

Do this long enough, and your confidence is going to drop. And when confidence drops, anxiety is sure to rise.  
这样做足够长的时间，你的信心就会下降。当信心下降时，焦虑肯定会上升。

Thankfully, you can reduce your anxiety and boost your confidence by [practicing assertiveness](https://nickwignall.com/assertiveness/) with the people in your life.  
值得庆幸的是，您可以通过与生活中的人练习自信来减少焦虑并增强信心。

The key is to start small:  
关键是从小处着手：

-   Take back that Starbucks drink they got wrong and ask for another.  
    收回他们弄错的星巴克饮料，并要求另一个。
-   When the meeting room gets awkwardly silent after your manager asks who wants to take on the new project, tolerate the awkwardness and let someone else take it.  
    当你的经理问谁想接手新项目后，会议室变得尴尬地沉默时，请容忍这种尴尬，让别人接手。
-   Tell your spouse, “no, actually, I think I’d prefer Thai food tonight.”  
    告诉你的配偶，“不，实际上，我想我今晚更喜欢泰国菜。

Obviously, it’s good to think about other people and be considerate of their wants and needs.  
显然，考虑他人并考虑他们的需求是件好事。

But like anything, this can be taken too far.  
但就像任何事情一样，这可能走得太远了。

If you want to reduce your chronic anxiety, [start sticking up for yourself](https://nickwignall.com/assertiveness/) and your own wants and needs a little more.  
如果你想减少你的慢性焦虑，开始坚持自己和你自己的需求和需求。

---

## All You Need to Know  
你需要知道的一切

If you want to lower your anxiety for good, you need to identify and reduce the core mechanisms maintaining your anxiety.  
如果你想永远降低你的焦虑，你需要识别和减少维持焦虑的核心机制。

Practice tolerating uncertainty instead of avoiding it.  
练习容忍不确定性，而不是避免不确定性。

Accept your helplessness instead of numbing it out.  
接受你的无助，而不是麻木它。

Manage your stressors, not your stress.  
管理你的压力源，而不是你的压力。

Be assertive about your own wants and needs.  
对自己的需求和需求保持自信。
