As a therapist, I work with a lot of very unhappy people each day.  

作为一名治疗师，我每天都和很多非常不快乐的人一起工作。

And while there are many reasons for unhappiness, there’s one factor that magnifies emotional suffering more than almost anything else:  

虽然不快乐的原因有很多，但有一个因素比几乎任何事情都更能放大情感痛苦：

**Few things make us more miserable than being in an unhealthy romantic relationship.**  

**没有什么比处于不健康的浪漫关系中更让我们痛苦的了。**

And how do people find themselves in unhappy relationships? Often it’s because they got into a long-term relationship with someone who was emotionally immature.  

人们如何发现自己处于不愉快的关系中？通常是因为他们与情感不成熟的人建立了长期的关系。

On the other hand, one of the best things you can do to improve your mental health and happiness is to avoid getting romantically involved with emotionally immature people in the first place.  

另一方面，为了改善心理健康和幸福，你能做的最好的事情之一就是首先避免与情感不成熟的人发生浪漫关系。

Here are a few red flags to watch out for…  

这里有一些需要注意的危险信号...

## 1\. They’re All Talk and No Action  
1.他们都是空谈，没有行动

If I had a quarter for every time I heard the following, I’d be writing this essay from a villa in the French Riviera:  

如果我每次听到以下内容时都有四分之一的时间，我会在法国里维埃拉的别墅里写这篇文章：

> I can’t believe I didn’t see it earlier… He talks a good game but he just never follows through on anything.  
> 
> 我简直不敢相信我没有早点看到它...他谈得很好，但他从不坚持任何事情。

The reason we all tend to fall for people who talk a good game but never follow through stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what falling in love really means.  

我们之所以倾向于爱上那些说得很好的游戏，但从不坚持到底的人，源于对坠入爱河真正意味着什么的根本误解。

**Contrary to the Disney mythology, falling in love is a transaction: Two people find each other sexually attractive and work like hell to convince the other person that they’re the greatest thing since sliced bread.**

**与迪斯尼神话相反，坠入爱河是一种交易：两个人发现对方有性吸引力，并像地狱一样工作，以说服对方他们是自切片面包以来最伟大的事情。**

Of course, with 10 years of unhappy marriage under your belt, it’s easy to see in hindsight that 90% of what they *claimed* was crap. But at the moment—when your brain’s flooded with oxytocin and every fiber of your being is vibrating with sexual energy—you tend to focus on the good stuff and ignore some pretty obvious warning signs.  

当然，在你经历了10年不幸的婚姻之后，事后很容易看出他们声称的90%都是废话。但此刻——当你的大脑充斥着催产素，你体内的每一根纤维都在用性能量振动——你倾向于专注于好东西，而忽略了一些非常明显的警告信号。

Because, after all, your body doesn’t care about your future marital bliss—all it cares about is your genes getting passed on.  

因为，毕竟，你的身体并不关心你未来的婚姻幸福——它所关心的只是你的基因是否被传递。

Now, I have nothing against falling in love. It’s one of the greatest feelings and experiences we get in life. And there’s no reason you can’t have it *and* a happy long-term relationship. You just have to be willing to look for the not-so-good stuff from the beginning. And one of the most important parts of that is noticing discrepancies between words and actions.  

现在，我不反对坠入爱河。这是我们在生活中得到的最伟大的感受和经历之一。没有理由你不能拥有它和一段幸福的长期关系。你只需要从一开始就愿意寻找不太好的东西。其中最重要的部分之一是注意言语和行动之间的差异。

Here are a few examples of what it looks like when someone’s actions don’t line up with their talk:  

以下是一些示例，说明当某人的行为与他们的谈话不一致时的样子：

-   They *tell* you that they’re fine with you spending time with friends on Saturdays but then give you grief about it all week.  
    
    他们告诉你，他们对你在周六和朋友共度时光很好，但随后整个星期都会让你感到悲伤。
-   They *say* work-life balance is really important but routinely spend late nights at the office.  
    
    他们说工作与生活的平衡非常重要，但经常在办公室度过深夜。
-   They *explain* how open-minded they are about your unorthodox political views but make sarcastic comments about them whenever politics comes up.  
    
    他们解释了他们对你的非正统政治观点的开放态度，但每当政治出现时，他们都会讽刺他们。

No matter how gorgeous or funny they are, if you get involved with someone who can’t consistently line up their actions with their words, you’re going to be miserable with them.  

无论他们多么华丽或有趣，如果你和一个不能始终如一地将他们的行为与他们的言语保持一致的人交往，你就会对他们感到痛苦。

So do your future self a favor and just say no to psychological stunted Romeos and emotionally immature Juliets.  

所以帮你未来的自己一个忙，对心理发育不良的罗密欧和情感不成熟的朱丽叶说不。

## 2\. They’re Unwilling to Be Vulnerable  

2\. 他们不愿意脆弱

Happy long-term relationships are built on trust. And trust requires intimacy—the ability to freely share and be honest with each other about everything from your hopes and dreams to your deepest fears and insecurities.  

幸福的长期关系建立在信任的基础上。信任需要亲密关系——能够自由地分享和诚实地对待从你的希望和梦想到你最深的恐惧和不安全感的一切。

But when you’re not able to be intimate, it creates gaps in the relationship. And eventually, these gaps grow into gulfs. Create enough gulfs in your relationship and at best you turn into very civil roommates. But more commonly, it leads to chronic resentment and loneliness.  

但是当你无法亲密时，它会在关系中造成差距。最终，这些差距会变成鸿沟。在你们的关系中制造足够的鸿沟，充其量你会变成非常文明的室友。但更常见的是，它会导致长期的怨恨和孤独。

But here’s the things: while almost everybody can be intimate in some areas of their life, they often struggle in other areas:  

但事情是这样的：虽然几乎每个人都可以在生活的某些领域保持亲密，但他们经常在其他领域挣扎：

-   Maybe they have no trouble with sexual intimacy but ask them to talk about their childhood and they freeze up and shut down.  
    
    也许他们在性亲密方面没有问题，但要求他们谈论他们的童年，他们冻结并关闭。
-   Or maybe they’re perfectly capable of being intimate with their dreams and aspirations, but refuse to talk about failures and losses.  
    
    或者，也许他们完全有能力与自己的梦想和抱负保持亲密关系，但拒绝谈论失败和损失。

The reason some people have a hard time being intimate often comes down to issues of emotional vulnerability. They have a hard time opening up and being honest if it exposes certain painful emotions that they’ve kept locked away.  

有些人很难亲密的原因通常归结为情感脆弱的问题。他们很难敞开心扉，如果它暴露了他们一直锁起来的某些痛苦情绪，他们就很难敞开心扉。

And while [emotional vulnerability](https://nickwignall.com/emotional-vulnerability/) is something that can be worked on and improved—and along with it, the capacity for intimacy—they have to be *willing* to do it.  

虽然情感上的脆弱是可以解决和改善的——随之而来的是亲密关系的能力——但他们必须愿意这样做。

So, when you’re dating or considering getting into a long-term relationship, look carefully for signs of difficulty with emotional vulnerability. And if you find some, try to look for signs that your partner is at least willing to try being more emotionally vulnerable:  

因此，当您约会或考虑建立长期关系时，请仔细寻找情感脆弱困难的迹象。如果你找到了一些，试着寻找你的伴侣至少愿意尝试在情感上更脆弱的迹象：

-   Are they willing to at least talk about painful past experiences or memories?  
    
    他们是否愿意至少谈论痛苦的过去经历或记忆？
-   Are they willing to [try therapy or counseling](https://nickwignall.com/does-everyone-need-therapy/) to work through difficulties with vulnerability?  
    
    他们是否愿意尝试治疗或咨询来克服脆弱的困难？
-   And perhaps most importantly, do they acknowledge their difficulty with vulnerability?  
   
	也许最重要的是，他们是否承认自己在脆弱性方面的困难？

We all have weaknesses and sensitive spots, things we’d rather keep hidden. But if you’re going to get into a long-term relationship, it’s essential that you find someone who’s willing to work on themselves, even when it’s painful.  

我们都有弱点和敏感点，我们宁愿隐藏的东西。但是，如果你要建立一段长期的关系，你必须找到一个愿意为自己努力的人，即使这很痛苦。

## 3\. They Make You Feel Bad for Feeling Bad  

3.他们让你因为感觉不好而感到难过

*Guilt-tripping*… [*Gaslighting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)… Call it whatever you want, but when your partner constantly makes you feel bad for feeling bad, it’s time to move on.  

内疚绊倒...煤气灯...随便你怎么称呼它，但是当你的伴侣不断让你因为感觉不好而感到难过时，是时候继续前进了。

One of the problems with dating someone who’s emotionally immature is that the relationship always ends up being about them. People with chronically low [self-esteem](https://nickwignall.com/how-to-like-yourself-more/) and major insecurities are always looking for ways to feel better. And often this comes at the expense of other people.  

与情感不成熟的人约会的问题之一是，这段关系最终总是关于他们的。长期自卑和严重不安全感的人总是在寻找感觉更好的方法。这通常是以牺牲其他人为代价的。

For example, emotionally immature people tend to criticize others often. By pointing out how someone else is bad/incorrect/stupid, it makes them feel good/clever/smart. Because they can’t figure out a healthy way to feel good about themselves, they point out flaws in other people which, temporarily, makes them feel better about themselves in comparison.  

例如，情绪不成熟的人往往会经常批评别人。通过指出别人的坏/不正确/愚蠢，这让他们感觉良好/聪明/聪明。因为他们无法找到一种健康的方式来自我感觉良好，所以他们会指出其他人的缺点，这些缺点暂时使他们对自己感觉更好。

One particularly subtle but pernicious form of this is emotional guilt-tripping—making someone feel bad about feeling bad.  

一种特别微妙但有害的形式是情绪内疚绊倒——让某人对感觉不好感到难过。

Here’s an example: 

下面是一个示例：

Suppose you’d like your partner to spend less time on their phone when you’re together. So you bring this up with them and a difficult, emotionally-charged conversation ensues. Eventually, your partner tells you that “Well, if you weren’t so insecure this wouldn’t even have been an issue.”  

假设你希望你的伴侣在你们在一起时花更少的时间在手机上。所以你和他们提起这件事，一场艰难的、情绪化的谈话随之而来。最终，你的伴侣告诉你：“好吧，如果你不是那么缺乏安全感，这甚至不会成为问题。

That’s emotional guilt-tripping. They twist a perfectly normal feeling in you—frustration that your partner often isn’t very present when you’re together because of their phone—and try to frame it as something bad.  

这就是情感上的内疚。他们扭曲了你内心一种完全正常的感觉——当你在一起时，你的伴侣经常因为手机而感到沮丧——并试图把它框定为坏事。

Don’t fall for it. And if it becomes a pattern, that’s probably a sign that you’re dating someone who’s emotionally immature.  

不要上当。如果它成为一种模式，这可能表明你正在和一个情感不成熟的人约会。

If your partner’s too insecure to respond in a mature way to genuine feedback and criticism, they’re probably not worth your time.  

如果你的伴侣太没有安全感，无法以成熟的方式回应真正的反馈和批评，他们可能不值得你花时间。

## 4\. They’re Unwilling to Try New Things  
4\. 他们不愿意尝试新事物

If there’s one thing I hear over and over again about what is causing dissatisfaction in a marriage or long-term relationship is *rigidity*:  

如果我一遍又一遍地听到一件事，关于在婚姻或长期关系中引起不满的是僵化：

-   *She never wants to try anything new for holidays—it’s the same old routines year after year after year…  
    
    她从来不想在假期尝试任何新东西——年复一年地都是同样的老套路......*
-   *I’ve asked him many times if he could start helping out with some of the chores around the house and he just never does.  
    
    我问过他很多次，他是否可以开始帮忙做一些家务，但他从来没有这样做过。*
-   *I’m really worried about our finances, and even though I’ve suggested lots of budgeting ideas or talking to a financial planner, she just refuses to do anything differently.  
    
    我真的很担心我们的财务状况，即使我提出了很多预算想法或与财务规划师交谈，她就是拒绝做任何不同的事情。*
-   *He’s so stuck on parenting our kids the same way he was parented… He just can’t see that maybe we need to do something differently or at least learn about some different options.  
    
    他如此坚持以与养育孩子相同的方式养育我们的孩子......他只是看不出也许我们需要做一些不同的事情，或者至少了解一些不同的选择。*

On the other hand, one of the best signs that a romantic relationship will work out in the long-run is if each person demonstrates a willingness to try new things and learn to do things that are unusual or uncomfortable.  

另一方面，从长远来看，浪漫关系会成功的最好迹象之一是，如果每个人都表现出尝试新事物并学会做不寻常或不舒服的事情的意愿。

The key, of course, is to separate out talk from behavior.  

当然，关键是要把谈话和行为分开。

Everybody is going to *say* they’re open to learning new things, experimenting, taking advice and feedback, etc. But when you’re dating, you need to look for *evidence* that they’re willing and capable of this.  

每个人都会说他们愿意学习新事物、进行实验、接受建议和反馈等。但是当你约会时，你需要寻找证据证明他们愿意并且有能力这样做。

Ask yourself: 

问问自己：

-   Does the person I’m dating take feedback and criticism well? Or do they get defensive and argumentative?  
    我约会的人能很好地接受反馈和批评吗？还是他们变得防御和争论？
-   If I suggest doing something new or out of the ordinary, do they try to embrace it or only go along with it grudgingly?  
    如果我建议做一些新的事情或不寻常的事情，他们是试图接受它还是只是勉强接受它？
-   When they get stuck or have a hard time with something, do they ask for help or seek out advice?  
    当他们遇到困难或遇到困难时，他们会寻求帮助还是寻求建议？

Flexibility and the willingness to adapt in the face of adversity is one of the single greatest attributes when it comes to choosing a partner. Not only will you be able to get through tough times together with a minimum of stress and conflict, but your partnership will just be a hell of a lot more fun.  

灵活性和在逆境中适应的意愿是选择合作伙伴时最重要的属性之一。您不仅能够以最小的压力和冲突一起度过艰难时期，而且您的合作伙伴关系将更加有趣。

When you’re dating someone, look for behavioral evidence of flexibility and the willingness to learn and try new things.  

当你和某人约会时，寻找灵活性以及学习和尝试新事物的意愿的行为证据。

## 5\. They Insist on Getting the Last Word In  

5\. 他们坚持说了算

Now you might have read this subheading and thought to yourself:  

现在你可能已经读了这个副标题，心想：

> Yeah, yeah, so they like to get the last word in. It’s annoying, but that can’t be a deal-breaker, right?  
> 
> 是的，是的，所以他们喜欢说最后一句话。这很烦人，但这不会破坏交易，对吧？

Look, we all try and get the last word in every once in a while. We all like to feel right, and justified, and that we’ve “won” the conversation (as stupid as it seems in retrospect).  

看，我们都试图每隔一段时间得到最后一句话。我们都喜欢感觉正确和合理，并且我们已经“赢得”了谈话（回想起来似乎很愚蠢）。

What’s problematic is if you notice a *consistent pattern* of having to get the last word in during conversations and disagreements.  

问题是，如果你注意到在对话和分歧中必须获得最后决定权的一致模式。

If someone can’t help themselves from always needing to get the last word in, it’s often symptomatic of much more troubling underlying issues. Namely, they’re too insecure to tolerate acknowledging someone else as right. Their ego is so fragile that it can’t take “losing” even a single argument, regardless of who’s actually right.  

如果有人无法控制自己总是需要说最后一句话，这通常是更令人不安的潜在问题的征兆。也就是说，他们太没有安全感了，无法容忍承认别人是对的。他们的自我是如此脆弱，以至于无论谁是对的，它都无法“失去”哪怕一个论点。

That’s bad news. 

这是个坏消息。

If they can’t handle being wrong about where they parked the car, how are they gonna handle being wrong about forgetting to book a DJ for the wedding or missing your kid’s piano recital?  

如果他们无法处理错误地将车停在哪里，他们将如何处理忘记为婚礼预订DJ或错过孩子的钢琴独奏会的错误？

It might seem like a little thing that’s easy enough to tolerate, but it’s often a sign of much bigger problems below the surface.  

这似乎是一件很容易容忍的小事，但它通常是表面之下更大问题的征兆。

If you’re dating someone who insists on getting the last word in, maybe you should insist on going your separate ways?  

如果你和一个坚持说最后一句话的人约会，也许你应该坚持分道扬镳？

## 6\. They Constantly Ask for Reassurance  
6\. 他们不断寻求保证

Constant reassurance-seeking is often a sign of [chronic anxiety](https://nickwignall.com/chronic-anxiety/) and dependency issues.  

不断寻求安慰通常是慢性焦虑和依赖问题的征兆。

Perhaps the biggest myth people buy into when choosing a partner is the idea of complementarity as a good basis for a relationship:  

也许人们在选择伴侣时最大的神话是互补性作为关系的良好基础的想法：

-   *He’s so confident and self-assured that it really helps me with my anxieties and insecurities.  
    他是如此自信和自信，这真的帮助我克服了焦虑和不安全感。*
-   *I love how social and gregarious she is. She really helps me get out of my shell.  
    我喜欢她的社交和合群。她真的帮助我摆脱了困境。*
-   *I love how clever and funny he is. Our conversations always make me feel so much smarter.  
    我喜欢他的聪明和有趣。我们的谈话总是让我觉得自己聪明多了。*
-   *She’s so independent and creative. As a life-long rule-follower, she really helps me push the boundaries when I need to.  
    她是如此独立和富有创造力。作为一个终生遵守规则的人，她真的在我需要的时候帮助我突破界限。*

You hear couples say stuff like this all the time. And while there’s nothing wrong *per se* with a partner who’s temperament or preferences complement your own, it’s dangerous to rely on them or think that they’re always beneficial:  

你总是听到夫妻说这样的话。虽然伴侣的气质或偏好与你自己的气质或偏好相得益彰本身并没有错，但依赖他们或认为他们总是有益的是危险的：

-   No matter how confident you are, it’s never going to fix your partner’s insecurities.  
    
    无论你多么自信，它永远无法解决你伴侣的不安全感。
-   No matter how sociable you are, it’s not going to change the fact that your partner’s an introvert who generally enjoys low-key activities with a few good friends.  
    
    无论你多么善于交际，这都不会改变这样一个事实，即你的伴侣是一个内向的人，通常喜欢和几个好朋友一起低调的活动。

If you’re dating someone with significant issues of self-worth, anxiety, and low confidence, you cannot fix them no matter how many times you reassure them and tell them it will be okay. In fact, there’s a very good chance that you reassuring them makes their anxieties worse.  

如果你正在和一个有自我价值、焦虑和低自信问题的人约会，无论你向他们保证多少次并告诉他们没事，你都无法解决它们。事实上，你很有可能让他们放心，让他们的焦虑变得更糟。

What’s more, it’s very likely that over a long enough period of time you begin to resent them for it. You will resent the fact that they increasingly rely on you to make them feel secure and confident, and consequently, that they use your confidence as an excuse not to work on themselves.  

更重要的是，很可能在足够长的一段时间内，你开始怨恨他们。你会怨恨他们越来越依赖你来让他们感到安全和自信，因此，他们利用你的自信作为不为自己工作的借口。

Does this always happen? Of course not. But I see it constantly!  

这种情况总是发生吗？当然不是。但我经常看到它！

Now, I’m not at all suggesting you absolutely shouldn’t date or get involved with someone who struggles with anxiety or insecurities. My point is that you should think very carefully about it.  

现在，我一点也不建议你绝对不应该与那些在焦虑或不安全感中挣扎的人约会或交往。我的观点是，你应该非常仔细地考虑它。

And if you do, make sure you see good hard evidence that they’re willing to seriously work on their own insecurities independently of you.  

如果你这样做了，确保你看到确凿的证据，证明他们愿意独立于你认真地处理自己的不安全感。

## 7\. They Don’t Know What They Want  
7.他们不知道自己想要什么

It’s emotionally-risky to get involved with someone who can’t articulate or at least explore what really matters to them.  

与一个无法表达或至少无法探索对他们真正重要的事情的人交往在情感上是有风险的。

The reasoning is pretty straightforward:  

推理非常简单：

-   Few things are as predictive of long-term satisfaction in a relationship than having deeply compatible values.  
    很少有事情能比拥有深度兼容的价值观更能预测一段关系中的长期满足感。
-   If the person you’re dating can’t express a handful of things that really matter to them and why, that suggests they don’t really know what their values are.  
    如果你约会的人不能表达一些对他们来说真正重要的事情以及为什么，这表明他们并不真正知道自己的价值观是什么。
-   And if the person your dating doesn’t know what their values are, how can you possibly tell whether they’re compatible with your own?  
    如果你约会的人不知道他们的价值观是什么，你怎么可能知道他们是否与你自己的价值观兼容？

Now, having a clear set of values and principles is a complicated thing that often evolves over time.  

现在，拥有一套明确的价值观和原则是一件复杂的事情，通常会随着时间的推移而发展。

For example: When you’re in your 20s, maybe friendship really matters to you as a value. But when you’re in your 40s—with 3 kids and mortgage—maybe hanging out with your buddies isn’t quite as important as it once was compared to other values like family and financial stability.  

例如：当你20多岁的时候，也许友谊对你来说真的很重要。但是，当你40多岁的时候——有3个孩子和抵押贷款——也许和你的朋友出去玩并不像以前那样重要，而不是家庭和财务稳定等其他价值观。

So when I say be careful of dating someone who doesn’t know what they want, it doesn’t mean they have to be strictly adhering to this or that formal value system.  

因此，当我说小心与一个不知道自己想要什么的人约会时，这并不意味着他们必须严格遵守这个或那个正式的价值体系。

What you’re really looking for is someone who regularly thinks about their values, can articulate them reasonably well, and actively works toward them.  

你真正要找的是一个经常思考自己的价值观，能够很好地表达这些价值观，并积极朝着这些价值观努力的人。

So, how do you know if they know what they really want? Ask them! 

那么，你怎么知道他们是否知道他们真正想要什么？问他们！

-   *What are some principles in your life that you try to always adhere to?  
    在你的生活中，你试图始终坚持哪些原则？*
-   *What are you most passionate about?  
    你最热衷的是什么？*
-   *Tell me about a value you used to hold but have changed your mind on.  
    告诉我你曾经持有但改变主意的价值观。*
-   *What values have you inherited from your family?  
    你从你的家庭继承了什么价值观？*
-   *How important are formal value systems to you (e.g. religious commandments)?  
    正式的价值体系对你有多重要（例如宗教诫命）？*
-   *What values do you think it’s important that we share and see basically eye-to-eye on?  
    您认为我们分享和看待的价值观是什么重要？*
-   *What are your political values? Ethical values? Career values? Creative values?  
    你的政治价值观是什么？道德价值观？职业价值观？创意价值？*

When you ask questions like this, what happens? Does your partner get uncomfortable and evasive? Are they willing to explore these, even if they are a little uncomfortable? Do they give genuine, heartfelt answers or do they respond in cliches and superficialities?  

当你问这样的问题时，会发生什么？你的伴侣会感到不舒服和逃避吗？他们是否愿意探索这些，即使他们有点不舒服？他们是给出真诚、发自内心的答案，还是以陈词滥调和肤浅的方式回应？

Everybody has values, no matter how ill-defined or vague. And eventually, those values will matter a lot in your relationship.  

每个人都有价值观，无论多么定义不清或模糊。最终，这些价值观在你们的关系中将非常重要。

Be carefully dating someone who isn’t mature enough to think about and be willing to talk about their values.  

小心翼翼地与一个不够成熟、无法思考并愿意谈论他们的价值观的人约会。

## All You Need to Know  
你需要知道的一切

Few things lead to more chronic unhappiness and stress than being in an unhealthy long-term relationship. And the reason so many people find themselves there is that they get involved with emotionally immature people who simply aren’t capable of being in a healthy relationship.  

很少有事情比处于不健康的长期关系中更能导致长期的不快乐和压力。这么多人发现自己在那里的原因是，他们与情感上不成熟的人交往，这些人根本无法建立健康的关系。

If you find yourself dating seriously and considering a long-term romantic relationship or marriage, keep a close eye out for the following warning signs of emotional immaturity: 

如果您发现自己认真约会并考虑长期恋爱关系或婚姻，请密切关注以下情感不成熟的警告信号：

**They’re All Talk and No Action**  
**他们都是空谈，没有行动**  

**They’re Unwilling to Be Vulnerable**  
**他们不愿意脆弱**  


**They Make You Feel Bad for Feeling Bad**  
**他们让你因为感觉不好而感到难过**  


**They’re Unwilling to Try New Things**  
**他们不愿意尝试新事物**  


**They Insist on Getting the Last Word In**  
**他们坚持要说最后一句话**  


**They Constantly Ask for Reassurance**  
**他们不断要求保证**  


**They Don’t Know What They Want**  

**他们不知道自己想要什么**  


Of course, everybody does these things *sometimes.* But if you find yourself dating someone who does several of them consistently, with no willingness to acknowledge them or work on them, just be careful.  

当然，每个人有时都会做这些事情。但是，如果你发现自己和一个持续做其中几个的人约会，不愿意承认它们或努力，那就要小心了。
