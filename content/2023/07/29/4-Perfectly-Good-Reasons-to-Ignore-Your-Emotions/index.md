People are often shocked to hear a psychologist tell them that it’s okay to ignore their emotions.

当人们听到心理学家告诉他们忽略自己的情绪是可以的时，他们常常会感到震惊。

This is partly reactionary…

这在一定程度上是反动的……

We see how problematic it can be to *never* acknowledge emotions—maybe because you were raised by someone who never did, for example. But we then mistakenly swing to the other extreme of obsessing over how we feel and treating emotions as sacred cows.

我们看到，从不承认情绪会带来多大的问题——例如，也许是因为你是由一个从未承认过情绪的人抚养长大的。但我们随后错误地转向了另一个极端，即痴迷于自己的感受，并将情绪视为神圣的事物。

But the best outcomes—and healthiest minds—are the result of a balanced approach to emotions.

但最好的结果——以及最健康的头脑——是平衡情绪的结果。

**It’s good to be aware of your emotions, but there are plenty of situations where you should ignore them.

意识到自己的情绪是件好事，但在很多情况下你应该忽略它们。**

Think about your emotions like your good friends: Even if they always have your best intentions at heart, that doesn’t make them immune from giving you terrible advice sometimes—in which case you should respectfully ignore them and go about your business.

像你的好朋友一样思考你的情绪：即使他们总是把你最好的意图放在心上，但这并不能让他们避免有时给你提供糟糕的建议——在这种情况下，你应该尊重地忽略他们并继续你的事情。

If you want to create a healthier, more balanced relationship with your emotions, learning when to ignore them is just as important as learning when to follow them.

如果你想与自己的情绪建立更健康、更平衡的关系，学习何时忽略它们与学习何时跟随它们同样重要。

Here are four situations where it can be useful to ignore your emotions.

在以下四种情况下，忽略自己的情绪可能会很有用。

---

## 1. When they conflict with your values

1.当它们与你的价值观相冲突时

Let’s say you’re heading out the door to a dinner party with your spouse when they ask you:

假设您正准备与配偶一起出门参加晚宴，这时他们问您：

> Be honest, does this shirt make me look fat?
> 
> 说实话，这件衬衫让我看起来胖吗？

You immediately feel a swell of anxiety. In your head, you’re imagining saying “yes” because you do think it’s pretty unflattering. But then you think to yourself “What if he feels hurt? Then he’s going to be irritated or sad for the rest of the night.”

你立即感到一阵焦虑。在你的脑海里，你想象着说“是”，因为你确实认为这很不讨人喜欢。但随后你会想：“如果他感到受伤怎么办？然后他会在整个晚上感到恼怒或悲伤。”

In this case, the emotion of anxiety is directing you to tell a white lie and say “no” in order to avoid any unpleasantness between the two of you for the evening.

在这种情况下，焦虑情绪会引导你说一个善意的谎言并说“不”，以避免今晚两人之间出现任何不愉快的情况。

On the other hand, you and your spouse have a value of being honest with each other—even when it’s uncomfortable. Your value of honesty is pulling you in the opposite direction as your emotion of anxiety.

另一方面，你和你的配偶都重视彼此诚实——即使这会让你感到不舒服。你的诚实价值观正把你拉向与你的焦虑情绪相反的方向。

So what do you choose? Ignore the value and follow the emotion? Or ignore the emotions and follow the value?

那么你选择什么？忽视价值而追随情感？还是忽略情感而追随价值？

I recommend choosing values over emotions every time, for two reasons:

我建议每次都选择价值观而不是情感，原因有两个：

1.  **You’ll get better outcomes.** It’s true—your spouse might feel a little disappointed or even irritated if you’re honest and tell him you don’t think it’s very flattering—especially if you’re not very tactful about how you phrase it! But you’ve been honest and given him accurate information, which allows him to make a better decision. And that’s what he really wants.

    你会得到更好的结果。确实如此——如果你诚实地告诉你的配偶你认为这不太讨人喜欢，你的配偶可能会感到有点失望，甚至恼怒——尤其是如果你的措辞不太得体的话！但你一直很诚实，给了他准确的信息，这让他能够做出更好的决定。这就是他真正想要的。
 
2.  **You’ll feel better (in the end).** Emotions are designed to help you make decisions quickly. And as such, they often lead to feeling better in the short term. But when they’re not aligned with your values, they can also lead to feeling worse in the long term. For example, if you get in the habit of lying to your partner about how they look, eventually they won’t trust you as much. And that lack of trust will lead to a lot of resentment and conflict long term.

    你会感觉更好（最终）。情绪旨在帮助您快速做出决定。因此，它们通常会在短期内让人感觉更好。但当它们与你的价值观不一致时，从长远来看，它们也会导致你感觉更糟。例如，如果你养成了对伴侣的外表撒谎的习惯，最终他们就不会那么信任你了。缺乏信任将导致长期的大量怨恨和冲突。

Remember that how you feel emotionally is only one source of input into your decision-making process. And it’s not infallible.

请记住，您的情绪感受只是您决策过程的输入来源之一。这并不是绝对正确的。

**Just like people can give bad advice, or your reasoning can be flawed, so too can your emotions be misguided.

就像人们可能会给出不好的建议，或者你的推理可能有缺陷一样，你的情绪也可能会被误导。

When push comes to shove, choose values over emotions.

当事情到了紧要关头时，选择价值观而不是情感。

## 2. When they lead to aggression

2.当它们导致攻击行为时

Anger is an interesting if misunderstood emotion.

愤怒是一种有趣但被误解的情绪。

On the one hand, anger is often a helpful motivator for making healthy change:

一方面，愤怒通常是做出健康改变的有用动力：

-   When people revolt against unjust rulers and tyrants, it’s usually anger that motivates and sustains the energy necessary to pull off something as difficult as a revolution.
    
    当人们反抗不公正的统治者和暴君时，通常是愤怒激发并维持了完成革命这样困难的事情所需的能量。

-   When someone finally stands up to an abuser, it’s often anger motivating that kind of courage and bravery.
    
    当有人最终站起来对抗施虐者时，通常是愤怒激发了这种勇气和勇敢。

-   In the right dose, self-directed anger can even be a useful prompt for pushing ourselves to grow or make amends for a mistake.
    
    在适当的剂量下，自我导向的愤怒甚至可以成为推动我们成长或弥补错误的有用提示。

On the other hand, anger easily leads to unhealthy aggression and violence:

另一方面，愤怒很容易导致不健康的攻击性和暴力：

-   Hate crimes, prejudice, and oppression are often motivated by anger.
    
    仇恨犯罪、偏见和压迫往往是由愤怒引发的。

-   Rude or insensitive communication with our friends or family is often motivated by unaddressed anger.
    
    与朋友或家人的粗鲁或麻木不仁的沟通往往是由于未得到解决的愤怒而引起的。

-   Self-harm and depression are often the results of unchecked self-directed anger.
    
    自残和抑郁往往是不受控制的自我愤怒的结果。

Like all emotions, anger can be useful at times and harmful at others. Which means it’s important to [be aware of our anger](https://nickwignall.com/secret-life-of-anger/) and then willing to ignore it if it’s leading to aggressive action.

与所有情绪一样，愤怒有时可能有用，有时却有害。这意味着重要的是要意识到我们的愤怒，然后在它导致攻击性行为时愿意忽略它。

Notice that awareness of anger and ultimately choosing to ignore it are not mutually exclusive. In fact, it’s crucial to listen to your emotions and understand them if you’re going to be able to respond to them in a healthy, productive way—whether that means following them or ignoring them.

请注意，意识到愤怒和最终选择忽视它并不是相互排斥的。事实上，如果你想要以健康、富有成效的方式回应你的情绪，无论这意味着跟随它们还是忽略它们，倾听并理解它们是至关重要的。

*But isn’t it unhealthy to suppress your anger?

但压抑愤怒不是不健康吗？*

No. This is an old superstition from the days of Freud.

不，这是弗洛伊德时代的古老迷信。

Emotional suppression, when used judiciously, is a perfectly healthy and necessary emotional skill. And in the case of anger, specifically, we know from decades of research that elaborating on or venting your anger only intensifies it. Whereas ignoring it actually helps to alleviate it.

如果明智地使用情绪抑制，那么它是一种完全健康且必要的情绪技能。具体来说，就愤怒而言，我们从数十年的研究中得知，阐述或发泄愤怒只会加剧愤怒。而忽视它实际上有助于缓解它。

So, if you find your anger getting the best of you and leading you to unwise decisions and behaviors, feel free to explore it and try and understand it. But at the end of the day, it’s perfectly okay to ignore your anger when necessary.

所以，如果你发现你的愤怒占据了你的上风，导致你做出不明智的决定和行为，请随意探索它并尝试理解它。但归根结底，必要时忽略你的愤怒是完全可以的。

## 3. When they lead to worry

3.当它们导致担忧时

Worry and anxiety go together like bacon and eggs.

忧虑和焦虑就像培根和鸡蛋一样在一起。

As long-time readers of my blog will know, I spend a lot of time talking about how worry leads to anxiety:

正如我博客的长期读者所知，我花了很多时间谈论担忧如何导致焦虑：

-   When you feel anxious about an upcoming date, it’s because you’re worrying about how it could go wrong… “Will they think these pants are trying too hard? What if I’m not funny enough? I’ll probably end up saying something insensitive and it’ll be super embarrassing.” etc.
    
    当你对即将到来的约会感到焦虑时，是因为你担心它会出问题……“他们会认为这条裤子太难了吗？如果我不够有趣怎么办？我最终可能会说一些不敏感的话，这会非常尴尬。” ETC。

-   When you feel anxious about your kid’s first day at school, it’s because you’re worrying: “What if she doesn’t fit in with the other kids and is lonely? What if her teacher isn’t sympathetic to her learning differences?” etc.
    
    当你对孩子第一天上学感到焦虑时，那是因为你在担心：“如果她与其他孩子格格不入并且感到孤独怎么办？如果她的老师不理解她的学习差异怎么办？” ETC。

And while it’s true that [the act of worrying is the cause of anxiety](https://nickwignall.com/engine-of-anxiety/), it’s also true that the feeling of anxiety can be a trigger for worry, which then leads to even more anxiety.

虽然担忧的行为确实是焦虑的原因，但焦虑的感觉也确实可能引发担忧，进而导致更多的焦虑。

The reason for this is subtle but important…

其原因很微妙但很重要……

Many people convince themselves that worrying is helpful, and as a result, feel slightly less anxious in the short term. The problem is that the short term anxiety relief isn’t worth the long term costs which include even greater anxiety as well as the lost time and energy that could have been productively invested elsewhere.

许多人说服自己，担心是有帮助的，因此在短期内感觉焦虑会稍微减轻一些。问题在于，短期的焦虑缓解不值得付出长期的代价，其中包括更大的焦虑以及浪费的时间和精力，这些时间和精力本可以有效地投入到其他地方。

For example: 例如：

-   That 10 minutes you spent worrying about whether your daughter’s teacher will be sensitive to her specific learning challenges not only led to long term stress and anxiety but it also was time you could have spent composing an email to her teacher explaining her challenges in detail.
    
    你花 10 分钟担心你女儿的老师是否会对她的具体学习挑战敏感，不仅会导致长期的压力和焦虑，而且你本可以花时间给她的老师写一封电子邮件，详细解释她的挑战。

-   All that time spent worrying about how your date would go led to you feeling especially [stressed out](https://nickwignall.com/stressed-out/) and anxious when the date actually came. So you created a self-fulfilling prophecy of the date not turning out well because of the worry about it.
    
    花那么多时间担心约会会如何进行，会让你在约会真正到来时感到特别紧张和焦虑。所以你创造了一个自我实现的预言，因为担心约会结果不会很好。

Here’s the takeaway: 要点如下：

**When you use worry as a way to distract yourself from anxiety, you only end up creating more anxiety and problems in the long-run.

当你用担心来分散自己对焦虑的注意力时，从长远来看，你最终只会制造更多的焦虑和问题。**

Often it’s better to [validate the anxiety](https://nickwignall.com/how-to-validate-your-emotions/) initially, then ignore it and move on with more productive activities.

通常，最好一开始就确认焦虑，然后忽略它并继续进行更有成效的活动。

## 4. When they lead to rumination

4.当它们引发沉思时

Just like anxiety can be a trigger for worry which then leads to even more anxiety, sadness and guilt can be triggers for [rumination](https://nickwignall.com/stop-ruminating/), which leads to even more sadness and guilt—even depression—long-term.

就像焦虑可能会引发担忧，从而导致更多的焦虑一样，悲伤和内疚也可能会引发沉思，从而导致更多的悲伤和内疚，甚至长期抑郁。

For example: 例如：

> You’re laying in bed trying to fall asleep, and an old memory of how you cheated on a college boyfriend pops into mind. You feel guilty and ashamed. But then, in response to that guilt and shame, you start replaying the events of that memory in your mind, analyzing and questioning details and telling yourself how terrible a person you were for doing it and how you should have done X, Y, and Z, instead. Now, as a result of all that rumination and self-criticism, you feel even more sad and ashamed of yourself, nothing is actually better about the situation in the past, and on top of everything else, you’re now wide awake and are going to have a very hard time falling asleep.

> 你躺在床上试图入睡，脑海中浮现出你如何欺骗大学男友的旧记忆。你感到内疚和羞愧。但随后，为了回应这种内疚和羞耻，你开始在脑海中重播那段记忆中的事件，分析和质疑细节，并告诉自己你是一个多么糟糕的人，做了这件事，以及你应该如何做X、Y和而是Z。现在，经过这么多的反省和自我批评，你感到更加悲伤和羞愧，过去的情况实际上没有什么比这更好的了，而且最重要的是，你现在已经完全清醒了，会很难入睡。

For a lot of people, painful emotions like sadness and guilt have become triggers for unhealthy rumination or [self-criticism](https://nickwignall.com/self-criticism/). And while they superficially feel productive, all they do is make you feel worse.

对于很多人来说，悲伤和内疚等痛苦情绪已经成为不健康的沉思或自我批评的触发因素。虽然他们表面上感觉很有成效，但他们所做的只是让你感觉更糟。

A better approach would be to acknowledge the sadness or guilt, validate it, then ignore it and put your attention elsewhere—maybe pull out a book or listen to a podcast until you feel sleepier.

更好的方法是承认悲伤或内疚，验证它，然后忽略它并将注意力转移到其他地方——也许拿出一本书或听播客，直到你感到更困为止。

Just because it *can* be helpful to explore and analyze your emotions and where they come from doesn’t mean it *always* is.

探索和分析你的情绪及其来源可能会有所帮助，但这并不意味着它总是如此。

When an old memory of a mistake pops into mind, the feeling of sadness or guilt is a totally normal reaction—almost like a reflex. But there’s no law of the Universe that says every time you have an emotion you have to explore it deeply and analyze the hell out of it.

当旧的错误记忆浮现在脑海中时，悲伤或内疚的感觉是完全正常的反应——几乎就像一种反射。但宇宙中并没有一条法则规定，每当你有一种情绪时，你就必须深入探索它并分析它的本质。

It’s perfectly okay to have an emotion and then focus on something else. In fact, that’s very often the healthiest thing you can do.

有一种情绪然后专注于其他事情是完全可以的。事实上，这通常是你能做的最健康的事情。
