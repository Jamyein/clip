## Need to know 需要知道

Every one of us has certain rules about how we behave in particular situations, relate to other people, or present ourselves in the world. But rule-following, like anything, can be taken too far. As a clinical psychologist, I often speak with people who have a strong preference for structure and order above all things, and I’ve observed what it’s like to be guided by rules in strict, often burdensome ways. Sometimes, the individuals I work with are not aware of the extent to which these rules impact their life – just as fish do not have a keen awareness that they are swimming in water. It’s just what they know. That is what it can be like for someone who rigidly adheres to certain rules.

我们每个人对于在特定情况下的行为方式、与他人的关系或在世界上展现自己的方式都有一定的规则。但与任何事情一样，遵守规则也可能走得太远。作为一名临床心理学家，我经常与那些对结构和秩序有强烈偏好的人交谈，我观察到以严格且往往繁琐的方式受规则指导的感觉。有时，与我一起工作的人并没有意识到这些规则对他们生活的影响程度——就像鱼没有敏锐地意识到它们在水中游泳一样。这只是他们所知道的。这就是那些严格遵守某些规则的人的情况。

If you sense that your own behaviour may be quite rule-governed, chances are you’ve noticed at least some ways that this can create difficulties for you. This Guide will help you reflect on those challenges further, and will also show how you can start safely relaxing your rules. You won’t have to make huge changes; often even a simple, small change can be helpful.

如果你感觉自己的行为可能相当受规则约束，那么你很可能已经注意到，这至少在某些方面会给你带来困难。本指南将帮助您进一步反思这些挑战，还将展示如何开始安全地放宽规则。你不必做出巨大的改变；通常，即使是一个简单的小改变也会有帮助。

Let’s start by imagining a spectrum, representing the ways you might relate to the rules you have for yourself. On one end, you consider a rule flexibly. This does not mean you completely abandon and break your rule (though, it could), but it might mean that you make your rule less absolute, or decide that you don’t have to follow it all the time. On the other end of the spectrum, you follow the rule rigidly. Life at the rigid end of this spectrum can become disrupted and problematic, even when the rules in question seem sensible.

让我们首先想象一个范围，代表您可能与自己制定的规则相关的方式。一方面，您可以灵活地考虑规则。这并不意味着你完全放弃并打破你的规则（尽管，它可以），但它可能意味着你使你的规则不那么绝对，或者决定你不必一直遵循它。另一方面，你严格遵守规则。即使所讨论的规则看起来合理，处于这个范围严格一端的生活也可能会变得混乱和有问题。

For example, someone may have a rule such as *I must always work hard*. They might be fully aware that this is a rule that they abide by, or they could just implicitly follow the rule and consider it unacceptable to not work hard. On its face, it might appear to be a helpful rule that makes a lot of sense. Consistently working hard might help you pass an exam, finish graduate school, or get a promotion. However, what if the rule *I must always work hard* is followed strictly and regardless of context, so that it means working while on vacation, or while sick, or simply working tirelessly throughout the day with no breaks?

例如，某人可能有一条规则，比如我必须始终努力工作。他们可能充分意识到这是他们必须遵守的规则，或者他们可能只是默默地遵守规则并认为不努力工作是不可接受的。从表面上看，这似乎是一条很有帮助、很有意义的规则。持续努力可能会帮助您通过考试、完成研究生学业或获得晋升。然而，如果“我必须始终努力工作”这一规则得到严格遵守，无论情况如何，这意味着在假期、生病或生病时工作，或者只是全天不知疲倦地工作，没有休息，该怎么办？

Take another seemingly fine rule: *Always be polite*. Politeness can help decrease conflict or signal friendly intentions. But what if *Always be polite* translates to never wanting to reveal disagreement with a close friend, family member or partner? Or what if it leads you to avoid asking for help (even a friendly favour) because doing so might seem ‘impolite’?

另一条看似不错的规则是：始终保持礼貌。礼貌可以帮助减少冲突或表达友好的意图。但是，如果“永远有礼貌”意味着永远不想与亲密的朋友、家人或伴侣透露分歧呢？或者，如果这导致您避免寻求帮助（即使是友好的帮助），因为这样做可能看起来“不礼貌”怎么办？

Here are a few other examples of rules that may be helpful in some ways but, if followed too rigidly, could have a negative impact:

以下是一些其他规则示例，这些规则可能在某些方面有所帮助，但如果过于严格地遵循，可能会产生负面影响：

-   *I must finish my to-do list every day.*
    
    *我必须每天完成我的待办事项清单。*

-   *I cannot let others see me upset.
    我不能让别人看到我难过。*

-   *I can’t share personal information with others until I fully understand what’s appropriate.
    在我完全了解什么是适当的之前，我无法与他人分享个人信息。*

-   *If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
    如果我想把某件事做好，我就必须自己做。*

**The costs of following rules too strictly

过于严格遵守规则的成本**

If overly rigid, rule-based tendencies are having a negative impact on your life, you might start to observe your anxiety or distress increasing, especially in situations where it is impossible to follow a rule. You may notice that it feels more challenging for you to adapt to changes. You might also feel an increase in bitterness, pessimism or other negative mood states.

如果过于严格、基于规则的倾向对你的生活产生负面影响，你可能会开始发现你的焦虑或痛苦不断增加，尤其是在无法遵守规则的情况下。您可能会注意到，适应变化对您来说更具挑战性。您可能还会感到痛苦、悲观或其他负面情绪状态增加。

Another common difficulty I’ve observed in my clinical practice is the way that very rigid rule-governed behaviours affect relationships. For example, one might have a rule that they have to finish cleaning up after dinner before doing anything else (such as watching a movie with the family). Or someone’s insistence that things must be cleaned *a certain way* may lead to re-cleaning after a family member helps out, because their work was not ‘up to standard’. For some, it may seem essential to finish a to-do list before committing to a social event. What might each of these examples signal to other people? Even if it’s unintended, these behaviours might suggest arrogance (ie, ‘My way is the best way’), or that spending time with others is not a priority. Moreover, not everyone in a person’s life necessarily accepts or wants to follow the same guidelines.

我在临床实践中观察到的另一个常见困难是非常严格的规则控制行为影响人际关系的方式。例如，人们可能有一条规则，要求他们必须在晚饭后完成清理工作，然后才能做其他事情（例如与家人一起看电影）。或者，某人坚持必须以某种方式清洁物品，这可能会导致在家庭成员帮忙后重新清洁，因为他们的工作不“符合标准”。对于某些人来说，在参加社交活动之前完成待办事项列表似乎很重要。这些例子可能向其他人传达什么信号？即使是无意的，这些行为也可能表明傲慢（即“我的方式是最好的方式”），或者与他人共度时光并不是优先考虑的事情。此外，并不是一个人生活中的每个人都一定接受或想要遵循相同的指导方针。

The downsides of rigid rule-adherence can also show up in work settings. For example, if a person has difficulty delegating tasks because they require things to be done a certain way, this could signal a lack of trust in coworkers. Over time, colleagues may learn to stop offering to lend a hand. This could, in turn, lead to isolation or resentment.

严格遵守规则的缺点也会在工作环境中显现出来。例如，如果一个人因为要求以某种方式完成任务而难以委派任务，这可能表明他对同事缺乏信任。随着时间的推移，同事们可能会学会不再主动伸出援手。反过来，这可能会导致孤立或怨恨。

Although not everyone who rigidly adheres to rules has a mental health condition, there are several specific conditions that are associated with this tendency. One is obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) – which is [estimated](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-21888-040) to affect at least 2 per cent of people and may involve excessive perfectionism, a desire to control, and a need for orderliness. Another such condition is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is reported to [affect](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd) about 1 per cent of adults in the US, and is characterised by obsessive thoughts or impulses as well as compulsive behaviours that serve to temporarily stop or neutralise obsessive thinking. Some [eating disorders](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-spot-signs-of-an-eating-disorder-in-a-loved-one), such as anorexia nervosa, are associated with rigid, rule-governed behaviours related to, for example, what’s acceptable to eat, eating in social situations, or exercise.

尽管并非每个严格遵守规则的人都存在心理健康问题，但有一些特定的情况与这种倾向相关。其中之一是强迫性人格障碍（OCPD）——据估计至少影响 2% 的人，可能涉及过度完美主义、控制欲和秩序感。另一种疾病是强迫症（OCD），据报道，这种疾病影响着美国约 1% 的成年人，其特点是强迫性思想或冲动，以及用于暂时停止或消除强迫性思维的强迫性行为。一些饮食失调，例如神经性厌食症，与严格的、受规则约束的行为有关，例如，可以吃什么、在社交场合吃东西或运动。

Researchers have also identified a ‘coping style’ that is related to rigid, rule-governed behaviours: overcontrolled coping. This pattern of excessive self-control is a main target of the evidence-based treatment called radically open dialectical behaviour therapy (RO-DBT), developed by the psychologist Thomas Lynch. RO-DBT has been used as a treatment for people with [chronic depression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6955577/), [OCPD](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315739243-34/radically-open-dialectical-behaviour-therapy-overcontrolled-disorders-thomas-lynch-dionysis-seretis-roelie-hempel?context=ubx&refId=186b7a3e-4357-4d0e-9fab-04c471e31fdf), [anorexia nervosa](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791621000021?via%3Dihub) and other conditions where we may find this overcontrolled coping style. In addition, in individual therapy, RO-DBT focuses on targeting five themes found in individuals with overcontrolled tendencies, one of the themes being rigid and rule-governed behaviours.

研究人员还发现了一种与严格的、受规则约束的行为有关的“应对方式”：过度控制的应对方式。这种过度自我控制的模式是心理学家托马斯·林奇 (Thomas Lynch) 开发的称为彻底开放辩证行为疗法 (RO-DBT) 的循证治疗的主要目标。 RO-DBT 已被用于治疗患有慢性抑郁症、强迫症、神经性厌食症和其他疾病的人，我们可能会发现这种过度控制的应对方式。此外，在个体治疗中，RO-DBT 侧重于针对具有过度控制倾向的个体中发现的五个主题，其中主题之一是僵化和规则管理的行为。

So there are established ways to practise being more flexible with rules, and they can be helpful whether or not you have a clinical diagnosis. In my work, I’ve seen that people who develop an openness to breaking or relaxing their rules often report improved relationships and overall mental health, an increased sense of belonging, and the ability to adapt more effectively to changing circumstances.

因此，有一些既定的方法可以练习更加灵活地遵守规则，无论您是否有临床诊断，它们都会有所帮助。在我的工作中，我发现那些愿意打破或放松规则的人往往会报告改善的人际关系和整体心理健康，增强的归属感以及更有效地适应不断变化的环境的能力。

You, too, can learn to cultivate a more relaxed stance toward personal rules. In the rest of this Guide, I’ll be drawing from RO-DBT, as well as another evidence-based therapeutic approach, [acceptance and commitment therapy](https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-live-a-values-driven-life-in-the-face-of-dark-emotions) (ACT), to share exercises for becoming more flexible and open about not always following your rules. As you’ll see, rules do not have to rule your life.

你也可以学会对个人规则采取更宽松的态度。在本指南的其余部分中，我将借鉴 RO-DBT 以及另一种循证治疗方法——接受与承诺疗法 (ACT)，来分享如何变得更加灵活和开放，不再总是遵循自己的规则。正如您将看到的，规则不必统治您的生活。

## What to do 该怎么办

**Recognise signs that you follow rules rigidly

识别您严格遵守规则的迹象**

I am sometimes asked: ‘How do I know if I’m following my rules in a rigid way?’ Here are a few ways to determine whether this is a tendency for you.

有时我会被问到：“我怎么知道我是否严格遵守了自己的规则？”这里有一些方法可以确定您是否有这种倾向。

First, consider the language that you might use to describe one or more of your personal rules. Does it include absolutistic ideas, such as: ‘I *must…*’, ‘I *have to…*’, ‘I can *never…*’ or ‘I should *always…*’? Rule-governed thinking along these lines can trigger inflexibility, and is sometimes referred to as all-or-nothing thinking. Recognising this type of language and thinking style helps to build an awareness that can prompt you to practise being more flexible with your rules.

首先，考虑您可能用来描述一项或多项个人规则的语言。它是否包含绝对主义的想法，例如：“我必须……”、“我必须……”、“我永远不能……”或“我应该总是……”？遵循这些规则的思维可能会导致缺乏灵活性，有时被称为“全有或全无”思维。认识到这种类型的语言和思维方式有助于建立一种意识，从而促使您练习更加灵活地遵守规则。

Second, ask yourself if you have any inflexible patterns of behaviour and whether you experience negative feelings if you need to change what you do. For example, do you follow the same exact morning routine every day? Is it difficult for you to do something different with your routine? Do you notice any anxiety or irritation if someone asks you to do something in a different way than usual (eg, at home or at work)? Increasing awareness around your behaviours and the ease with which you can shift behaviours can help build insight into whether you are heavily guided by rules.

其次，问问自己是否有任何僵化的行为模式，以及如果需要改变自己的行为，是否会产生负面情绪。例如，您每天早晨的例行公事是否完全相同？对你来说，做一些与你的日常生活不同的事情很难吗？如果有人要求您以与平时不同的方式（例如在家或工作时）做某事，您是否会感到焦虑或恼怒？提高对自己行为的认识以及改变行为的轻松程度可以帮助深入了解您是否严格遵守规则。

A third way to recognise if you are adhering too rigidly to rules is to start listening to and considering feedback from others. Note that this feedback, especially from close others, is usually informal and may be shared more frequently than you realise. Do others tease you or joke that you are a perfectionist, that things need to be done a certain way, or that you need to be in control all the time? These can all be forms of feedback. One individual shared that it was difficult for him to not re-clean the dishes after his room-mate cleaned them. His room-mate would laugh and joke: *‘*Oh no, I’d better not wash the dishes – I just don’t think I can get them clean enough!’

识别您是否过于严格遵守规则的第三种方法是开始倾听并考虑他人的反馈。请注意，这种反馈，尤其是来自亲密其他人的反馈，通常是非正式的，并且可能比您意识到的更频繁地分享。其他人是否会取笑您或开玩笑说您是完美主义者，事情需要以某种方式完成，或者您需要始终处于控制之中？这些都可以是反馈的形式。一位人士表示，他的室友洗完碗后，他很难不重新洗碗。他的室友会笑着开玩笑：“哦，不，我最好不要洗碗——我只是觉得我不能把它们洗得足够干净！”

If you have repeatedly received feedback about certain rule-governed behaviours, that could be a sign of too much rigidity. Here are some questions you might ask yourself: *Have I received similar feedback from others before? Am I wanting to dismiss this feedback? Is the behaviour I’m getting feedback on negatively impacting my relationships?* If you answer ‘yes’ to any of these questions, it’s worth reflecting on whether it could be beneficial to practise relaxing your rules.

如果您反复收到有关某些受规则约束的行为的反馈，这可能是过于僵化的迹象。您可能会问自己以下问题： 我以前收到过其他人的类似反馈吗？我想忽略这个反馈吗？我收到反馈的行为会对我的人际关系产生负面影响吗？如果您对这些问题中的任何一个回答“是”，那么就值得反思一下放松规则是否有益。

**Create distance between you and the rule

在你和规则之间建立距离**

Rather than attempting to change rules outright, I typically teach people to respond differently and more flexibly to rigid, rule-governed thinking. What if you could cultivate a new way to relate to rules so that they do not automatically determine what you do? A skill called ‘defusion’, derived from ACT, can help with this process. Keep in mind that the focus here is not on changing the rule itself.

我通常不会尝试彻底改变规则，而是教导人们以不同的方式、更灵活地应对僵化的、受规则约束的思维。如果您可以培养一种与规则相关的新方式，以便规则不会自动决定您的行为，结果会怎样？源自 ACT 的一项名为“解离”的技能可以帮助完成这一过程。请记住，这里的重点不是改变规则本身。

To practise this skill, you can identify one or more rigid rules that pop into your mind and that you have a hard time not following. Then choose one to focus on. Let’s say the rule is *I must do X a certain way*, where ‘X’ is a daily chore or another activity*.* To practise defusion, you might say to yourself (either out loud or internally): ‘I am noticing the thought that *I must do X a certain way*.’ Here, we are attempting to create some distance from this thought. Here’s another way you might put it: ‘There it is again, the *I must do this a certain way* rule!’

为了练习这项技能，你可以确定一个或多个突然出现在你脑海中并且很难不遵守的严格规则。然后选择一个重点。假设规则是我必须以某种方式做 X，其中“X”是日常琐事或其他活动。为了练习解离，你可以对自己说（无论是大声的还是内心的）：“我注意到我必须以某种方式做某事的想法。”在这里，我们试图与这种想法保持一定的距离。你可以用另一种方式表达：“又是这样，我必须以某种方式做这件事！”

Other ways to begin a defusion practice include:

开始解离练习的其他方法包括：

-   *I’m having the thought that* [insert rule here]*.*
    我的想法是[在此处插入规则]。
    
-   *There my mind goes again; I’m noticing the thought that…
    我的思绪又回到了那里；我注意到这样的想法…… *
    
-   *I am aware of the rule that…
    我知道规则是……*

Go ahead, give it a try and see what you notice. Most people say that it helps them find a moment of pause and, in that moment, some space is created that allows them to act differently in response to the automatic rule. Once you apply this to one rule, start using defusion with other rules that you have identified wanting to be more flexible about.

来吧，尝试一下，看看你注意到了什么。大多数人说，这可以帮助他们找到一个暂停的时刻，在那一刻，会创造一些空间，使他们能够以不同的方式响应自动规则。将其应用于一条规则后，开始与您已确定希望更加灵活的其他规则进行解构。

**Practise urge-surfing 练习冲动冲浪**

Urge-surfing is a mindfulness-based strategy used to help manage and delay responses to urges. You can ‘surf’ anything from the urge to smoke a cigarette to the urge to stand up and yell during a meeting, and you can also use this strategy when you have the urge to follow a rule.

冲动冲浪是一种基于正念的策略，用于帮助管理和延迟对冲动的反应。你可以“冲浪”任何东西，从抽烟的冲动到在会议期间站起来大喊大叫的冲动，当你有遵守规则的冲动时，你也可以使用这个策略。

You can practise urge-surfing at any time with the following steps:

您可以随时按照以下步骤练习冲动冲浪：

1. Begin by noticing your breath. Focus your attention on your inhales and exhales.
1. 首先注意你的呼吸。将注意力集中在吸气和呼气上。

2. As you practise noticing your breath, begin to be aware of any urges that arise. For example, maybe you notice an urge to tap your foot, to scratch an itch, to stand up, or to review your to-do list for the day.

2. 当你练习注意呼吸时，开始注意任何出现的冲动。例如，您可能会注意到想要轻拍脚、挠痒痒、站起来或查看当天的待办事项清单。

3. Practise not responding to whatever urges show up. For example:

3. 练习不要对出现的任何冲动做出反应。例如：

-   If you notice the urge to tap your foot, keep your foot still.
    如果您发现有想轻拍脚的冲动，请保持脚不动。

-   If you notice the urge to scratch your itch, do not give in to the urge to scratch it.
    如果您发现有想抓痒的冲动，请不要屈服于抓痒的冲动。

-   If you notice the urge to review your to-do list, practise bringing your attention back to focusing on your breath.
    如果您发现有检查待办事项清单的冲动，请练习将注意力重新集中在呼吸上。

4. Do this for a few minutes, allowing urges to come and go – just as waves crest and fall in the ocean.

4. 这样做几分钟，让冲动来来去去——就像海洋中的波浪起伏一样。

5. Finally, if you do decide to act on an urge (and scratch that itch, for example), then do so with an awareness of the action that you have chosen to take.

5. 最后，如果您确实决定根据冲动采取行动（例如，挠痒痒），那么请在意识到您选择采取的行动的情况下这样做。

This is urge-surfing, and it takes practice. I often recommend practising it for just two to five minutes a day, and doing so with any type of urge – it doesn’t have to be with rules initially. Urge-surfing allows you to see that, if you do not respond to an urge, even if the urge increases in intensity for a period of time, it will eventually pass.

这是冲动冲浪，需要练习。我经常建议每天练习两到五分钟，并且可以带着任何类型的冲动进行练习——最初不必遵守规则。冲动冲浪让你看到，如果你不对某种冲动做出反应，即使这种冲动在一段时间内强度增加，它最终也会过去。

As an example of how it could work, after noticing a very strong urge to tell people to arrive on time for a social event (to follow a rule that people must always be on time), one could use urge-surfing to inhibit that urge, and then instead decide to say something like: ‘You are welcome to come anytime in the afternoon.’ This represents a flexible response with regard to a rule.

作为其运作原理的一个例子，在注意到人们有一种非常强烈的冲动要求人们准时参加社交活动（遵循人们必须始终准时的规则）后，人们可以使用冲动冲浪来抑制这种冲动，然后决定说这样的话：“欢迎您下午随时来。”这代表了对规则的灵活回应。

**Try not doing what you say

尝试不按你所说的去做**

Can you think of a time when you persisted in doing something even while having a thought that went opposite to your behaviour? For example, perhaps you’ve had the thought that you couldn’t go to sleep unless you finished a certain task, but then you went to sleep anyway. The fact that you can have thoughts about what you ‘must’ or ‘must not’ do, and then *not* behave in accordance with those thoughts, is important to realise more fully.

你能想象一下，当你的想法与你的行为相反时，你仍然坚持做某事吗？例如，也许你曾经想过，除非完成某项任务，否则你无法入睡，但你还是睡着了。事实上，你可以思考自己“必须”或“不可以”做什么，然后不按照这些想法行事，这一点对于更充分地认识到这一点很重要。

*Don’t do what you say* is a lively ACT-based exercise developed by Jean-Louis Monestès and Matthieu Villatte, and it can be useful for people who follow rules in a rigid way. To see how it works, I invite you to say the following, out loud: ‘I cannot speak out loud.’ Look at that! You can have a thought, you can verbalise it, and you can then behave in a way that is independent of that thought. You can have some fun with this: I invite you to say (verbally or silently to yourself) ‘I must touch my nose’, and at the same time gently place your hand on the top of your head for a brief moment. Try this out a few times (I suggest up to 10 times in different ways; tell yourself you cannot stand and then stand, etc) so that you can really feel what it is like to do something different to what you are thinking or verbalising.

“不要按你说的做”是由 Jean-Louis Monestès 和 Matthieu Villatte 开发的一项基于 ACT 的生动练习，对于严格遵守规则的人来说可能很有用。为了看看它是如何运作的，我邀请你大声说出以下内容：“我不能大声说话。”看看那个！你可以有一个想法，你可以用语言表达它，然后你可以以独立于该想法的方式行事。你可以从中得到一些乐趣：我邀请你（口头或无声地对自己说）“我必须触摸我的鼻子”，同时轻轻地将你的手放在头顶上一小会儿。尝试几次（我建议以不同的方式最多尝试 10 次；告诉自己你不能站立，然后站起来，等等），这样你就能真正感受到做一些与你的想法或语言不同的事情是什么感觉。

You can apply this to rules in a way that helps you practise being more flexible – to *not* respond to every rule as if it’s something that *must* be followed. For example, the next time you notice the urge to rigidly follow a rule, such as having to finish your to-do list every day, remind yourself of this exercise. I suggest to people that I work with that, when they notice the rule, they can simply touch their nose while saying *I must listen and touch my elbow* as a powerful reminder that you do not have to do what you say. Silly? Maybe, but it’s another way to change how you relate to a rule.

你可以将其应用到规则中，以帮助你练习变得更加灵活——不要对每条规则都做出反应，就好像它是必须遵守的一样。例如，下次当您注意到严格遵守规则的冲动时，例如每天必须完成待办事项清单，请提醒自己进行此练习。我向那些与我一起工作的人建议，当他们注意到规则时，他们可以简单地触摸鼻子，同时说我必须听，并触摸我的肘部，作为一个强有力的提醒，你不必按照你所说的去做。愚蠢的？也许吧，但这是改变你与规则的关系的另一种方式。

Simply knowing that you do not always have to do what your rules say can help you behave differently, especially when you notice that rigid, rule-governed behaviours are getting in the way of things you care about.

只要知道你不必总是按照规则行事，就能帮助你以不同的方式行事，尤其是当你注意到严格的、受规则约束的行为妨碍了你关心的事情时。

**Practise breaking your rules

练习打破规则**

As you become more aware of rigid rules, you may gain insight into how certain rules are not as effective as they once seemed to be, or how applying rules in *every* context is not always helpful. There might be moments when a rule is effective and in line with your valued goals, and other moments when compromise and flexibility are needed.

随着您对严格规则的了解越来越多，您可能会深入了解某些规则为何不像以前看起来那样有效，或者在每种情况下应用规则并不总是有帮助。有时，规则是有效的并且符合您的价值观，而有时则需要妥协和灵活性。

In this step, we’ll play to one of your strengths: we are going to use your superior ability to follow rules to help you break them! I’m going to ask you to create a rule around breaking a rule. This could be something like: *I must break one rule every day.* Then, you’ll decide ahead of time what rule you are going to break. If someone has a rule that they must cross everything off their to-do list each day, breaking this rule could mean that they leave at least one or two items unfinished. Another example would be to ‘go opposite’ to a rule that you want to relax – eg, deliberately arriving to an event a bit late, rather than ensuring you arrive early.

在这一步中，我们将发挥您的优势之一：我们将利用您遵守规则的卓越能力来帮助您打破规则！我会要求你针对违反规则制定一条规则。这可能是这样的：我每天必须打破一项规则。然后，您将提前决定要打破什么规则。如果某人有一条规则，要求他们每天必须划掉待办事项清单上的所有内容，那么违反此规则可能意味着他们至少留下一两个未完成的项目。另一个例子是“违背”你想要放松的规则——例如，故意晚一点到达某个活动，而不是确保你早点到达。

The idea is to try, in small ways, to practise breaking rules. The key word here is ‘practise’. You may find that you have to think intentionally about breaking a rule most days, and that is OK. But know that, over time, doing this can help build psychological and behavioural flexibility, so you should start to find it easier to break a rule when you notice rigid rule-following getting in the way of work, relationships or overall mental health.

我们的想法是尝试以小方式练习打破规则。这里的关键词是“练习”。您可能会发现大多数时候您必须有意识地考虑是否要违反规则，这没关系。但要知道，随着时间的推移，这样做可以帮助建立心理和行为的灵活性，所以当你发现严格遵守规则妨碍工作、人际关系或整体心理健康时，你应该开始发现更容易打破规则。

Breaking rigid rules and behaving differently may make you uncomfortable or anxious at first. Fortunately, there are things you can do to help deal with that discomfort. Let’s turn to these next.

打破严格的规则和不同的行为一开始可能会让你感到不舒服或焦虑。幸运的是，您可以采取一些措施来帮助缓解这种不适。接下来让我们转向这些。

**Manage distress by calming your body

通过让身体平静来应对痛苦**

Sometimes, distress and anxiety result in unpleasant bodily reactions such as an increase in heart rate, shallow breathing, sweaty palms or tightness in the chest. The following skill helps you manage that physiological reaction. Observe what happens if you practise this with your body:

有时，痛苦和焦虑会导致不愉快的身体反应，例如心率加快、呼吸浅、手掌出汗或胸闷。以下技能可以帮助您管理这种生理反应。观察如果你用身体练习这个会发生什么：

-   Take a deep breath by slowly inhaling and exhaling, and simultaneously…
    慢慢吸气和呼气，深吸一口气，同时……

-   Engage in a closed-mouth smile (turn up the ends of your lips and stretch your lips over your teeth). Note that this type of smile activates the muscles around your eyes (where you typically see wrinkles). If you try this smile and only the bottom half of your face is moving, you may be practising what’s referred to as a half-smile. Ensure that you activate the muscles around your eyes.
    闭嘴微笑（卷起嘴唇末端并将嘴唇伸到牙齿上）。请注意，这种微笑会激活眼睛周围的肌肉（通常会看到皱纹的地方）。如果你尝试这种微笑，但只有下半张脸在动，那么你可能正在练习所谓的半微笑。确保激活眼睛周围的肌肉。

-   Raise your eyebrows for a moment.
    扬起眉毛一会儿。

-   Additionally, if you are sitting in a chair with a back, then lean back.
    此外，如果您坐在有靠背的椅子上，请向后倾斜。

This is an RO-DBT skill called ‘the Big Three + 1’, and it can help to calm down those anxious bodily reactions described above. Most people I teach this skill to find that, while it may be uncomfortable, awkward or just unfamiliar at first, with practice, it makes them feel more open, at ease, and a bit more relaxed – even if just for a brief moment. Importantly, if the experience of calm is indeed brief, then simply practise the Big Three + 1 again and again. These facial and body movements activate muscles that signal to the anxious part of your brain that all is OK, even when you’re in distress.

这是一种名为“三大+1”的RO-DBT技能，它可以帮助平息上述那些焦虑的身体反应。我教授这项技能的大多数人发现，虽然一开始可能会感到不舒服、尴尬或不熟悉，但经过练习，它会让他们感觉更开放、更自在、更放松——即使只是短暂的一刻。重要的是，如果平静的体验确实很短暂，那么只需一遍又一遍地练习“三巨头+1”。这些面部和身体动作会激活肌肉，向大脑中焦虑的部分发出信号，表明一切都很好，即使您处于痛苦之中。

An added benefit that’s highlighted in RO-DBT is what you signal to others when you lean back, raise your eyebrows, and/or smile. If you are breaking one of your rules while around other people and you practise this skill, take note of its impact on how you relate to others. Raising your eyebrows and smiling are friendly, inviting signals and, if improving your interactions with others is part of your motivation for relaxing your rules, this may be an important skill for you to try.

RO-DBT 强调的另一个好处是，当您向后靠、扬起眉毛和/或微笑时，您可以向他人发出信号。如果你在与其他人相处时违反了规则，并且练习了这项技能，请注意它对你与他人相处方式的影响。扬起眉毛和微笑是友好、邀请的信号，如果改善与他人的互动是你放宽规则的动机的一部分，那么这可能是你值得尝试的一项重要技能。

**Remind yourself why you’re relaxing your rules

提醒自己为什么要放宽规则**

Another way to respond to the anxiety or resistance that might result from trying to be more flexible is to reflect on what you value. If someone tells me: ‘Dr Doucette, I’m too anxious to break the rule,’ I ask them the following question: *Why did you want to work on this in the first place?* I might then hear things like:

应对因试图变得更加灵活而可能产生的焦虑或阻力的另一种方法是反思你看重的是什么。如果有人告诉我：“Doucette 博士，我太急于打破规则了，”我会问他们以下问题：你最初为什么想从事这个工作？然后我可能会听到这样的话：

-   ‘My loved ones are frustrated with my rigidity.’
    “我的亲人对我的僵化感到沮丧。”

-   ‘I know that it’s making my anxiety more intense.’
    “我知道这让我的焦虑更加强烈。”

-   ‘Working on this will help me improve my relationships.’
    “致力于此将帮助我改善我的人际关系。”

-   ‘I want to teach my children flexibility.’
    “我想教我的孩子们灵活性。”

-   ‘My rigid tendencies have prevented me from getting promoted at work.’
    “我的刻板倾向阻碍了我在工作中升职。”


How might you answer my question? What you are essentially doing here is identifying what you value. What is important about who you want to be or how you want to interact with others?

你会如何回答我的问题？你在这里所做的本质上是确定你看重什么。关于你想成为什么样的人或你想如何与他人互动，什么最重要？

Calling this to mind may or may not, on its own, decrease your distress around breaking rules. But remember this: while you may feel distress as you practise being more flexible about your rules, you will also experience distress and negative consequences if you continue rigidly adhering to every rule. Which of those paths gets you closer to what you value? Most of the time, people prefer to act based on what is most important to them, even when it’s difficult to do.

记住这一点本身可能会也可能不会减少你因违反规则而感到的痛苦。但请记住这一点：虽然当你练习对规则更加灵活时你可能会感到痛苦，但如果你继续严格遵守每条规则，你也会经历痛苦和负面后果。哪一条路径能让你更接近你所珍视的东西？大多数时候，人们更喜欢根据对他们来说最重要的事情来采取行动，即使这很难做到。

### Key points – How to relax your own rules

要点——如何放宽自己的规则

1.  **Personal rules can be followed in flexible or rigid ways.** A rule such as *I must always work hard* may be sensible, but can be taken to the extreme if you try to follow it perfectly.
    个人规则可以以灵活或严格的方式遵循。像我必须始终努力工作这样的规则可能是明智的，但如果你试图完美地遵循它，则可能会走向极端。

2.  **There are costs to following rules too strictly.** A pattern of overly rigid adherence to rules may increase distress, make it harder to adapt to change, and cause difficulties in relationships.
    过于严格地遵守规则是要付出代价的。过于严格遵守规则的模式可能会增加痛苦，使人更难适应变化，并导致人际关系困难。

3.  **Recognise signs that you follow rules rigidly.** All-or-nothing thinking (eg, ‘We must *always*…’ ‘I can *never*…’), discomfort about altered routines, or informal feedback from others can serve as clues.
    识别出您严格遵守规则的迹象。全有或全无的想法（例如，“我们必须始终……”“我永远不能……”）、对改变惯例的不适或来自他人的非正式反馈都可以作为线索。

4.  **Create distance between you and the rule.** Use the skill of defusion and observe a rule at arm’s length, such as by saying: ‘I am noticing the thought that *I must do X a certain way*.’
    在你和规则之间建立距离。使用解离技巧并保持一定距离遵守规则，例如说：“我注意到我必须以某种方式做 X 的想法。”

5.  **Practise urge-surfing.** Focus on your breathing, notice any urges that arise, and decline to act on them for a few minutes. This practice can show how the urge to follow a rule will pass if left alone.
    练习冲动冲浪。专注于呼吸，注意任何出现的冲动，并在几分钟内拒绝采取行动。这种做法可以表明，如果不去管的话，遵守规则的冲动将会如何消失。

6.  **Try not doing what you say.** Practise behaving at odds with your thoughts or words, such as saying aloud ‘I cannot speak out loud.’ It’s a reminder that you can think of a rule without having to follow it.
    尽量不要按照你说的去做。练习与你的想法或言语不一致的行为，例如大声说“我不能大声说话”。这提醒你，你可以想出一条规则，而不必遵守它。

7.  **Practise breaking your rules.** By deciding to not follow your rule to a tee, or even ‘going opposite’ to the rule, you can build psychological flexibility for the future.
    练习打破你的规则。通过决定不完全遵守你的规则，甚至与规则“相反”，你可以为未来建立心理灵活性。

8.  **Manage distress by calming your body.** ‘The Big Three + 1’ – taking slow breaths, smiling, raising your eyebrows and (if sitting) leaning back – may help you feel more open and relaxed.
    通过镇定身体来缓解痛苦。 “三大+1”——缓慢呼吸、微笑、扬起眉毛和（如果坐着）向后靠——可能会帮助你感觉更加开放和放松。

9.  **Remind yourself why you’re relaxing your rules.** Reflecting on who you want to be, or how you want your relationships to be, can motivate you to keep practising flexibility even when it’s challenging.
    提醒自己为什么要放宽规则。反思你想成为谁，或者你希望你的人际关系如何，可以激励你继续练习灵活性，即使这充满挑战。

**Seeking therapy for rigid, rule-based patterns of behaviour

寻求针对僵化、基于规则的行为模式的治疗**

If you feel like you are chronically struggling to relax your rules, or you would like more support to practise these skills, you have further options. The therapeutic modalities mentioned in this Guide – acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and radically open dialectical behaviour therapy (RO-DBT) – can both be used to address rigid, rule-governed behaviours, though they each have different mechanisms of change.

如果您觉得自己长期难以放松规则，或者您需要更多支持来练习这些技能，那么您还有其他选择。本指南中提到的治疗方式——接受与承诺疗法（ACT）和彻底开放的辩证行为疗法（RO-DBT）——都可以用来解决僵化的、受规则控制的行为，尽管它们各自有不同的改变机制。

With RO-DBT, the focus is on enhancing interpersonal connections with others. It works especially well with people who might rigidly apply rules and at the same time report that they also feel lonely and isolated. It has been employed with individuals who have OCPD, [anorexia](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40337-020-00338-9) nervosa, chronic [depression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30561967/) and [autism](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-bulletin/article/evaluation-of-radically-open-dialectical-behaviour-therapy-in-an-adult-community-mental-health-team-effectiveness-in-people-with-autism-spectrum-disorders/2BC4B0CF8DDBFCDCFD2CD9089545B4D8) spectrum disorders, among others. These conditions are sometimes referred to as disorders of overcontrol. If you want to feel more connected to others and improve your relationships, RO-DBT could be a helpful treatment approach. A trained RO-DBT professional can help you understand if you might benefit from this type of therapy; a list of where to find RO-DBT providers across the world can be found [here](https://www.radicallyopen.net/find-a-therapist.html).

RO-DBT 的重点是加强与他人的人际关系。对于那些可能严格遵守规则但同时也感到孤独和孤立的人来说，它尤其有效。它已被用于患有 OCPD、神经性厌食症、慢性抑郁症和自闭症谱系障碍等的个体。这些情况有时被称为过度控制障碍。如果您想与他人建立更紧密的联系并改善你们的关系，RO-DBT 可能是一种有用的治疗方法。训练有素的 RO-DBT 专业人员可以帮助您了解您是否可以从这种治疗中受益；您可以在此处找到全球范围内可找到 RO-DBT 提供商的列表。

With ACT, the goal is to increase what is [called](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act) psychological flexibility, with a focus on building skills to change how you relate to difficult thoughts and feelings – especially if those thoughts and feelings keep you from living in accordance with your values. Important themes include acceptance, mindfulness, making commitments to take action, and values-exploration. With ACT, you learn how to act in a way that is based on what is important to you (your values) rather than based on strict rules. There are a lot of ACT workbooks and self-help materials that take readers through these skills and concepts (see the Links and Books section below), and which can complement individual therapy sessions or help you explore whether you might like to work with a professional who uses this approach. If you are interested in finding an ACT-trained therapist, you can see this [listing](https://contextualscience.org/civicrm/profile?gid=17&reset=1&force=1) of providers.

ACT 的目标是提高所谓的心理灵活性，重点是培养技能，以改变你如何处理困难的想法和感受——尤其是当这些想法和感受阻碍你按照自己的价值观生活时。重要的主题包括接受、正念、承诺采取行动和价值观探索。通过 ACT，您将学习如何根据对您重要的事情（您的价值观）而不是严格的规则来行事。有很多 ACT 练习册和自助材料可以引导读者了解这些技能和概念（请参阅下面的链接和书籍部分），并且可以补充个人治疗课程或帮助您探索是否愿意与专业人士合作谁使用这种方法。如果您有兴趣寻找经过 ACT 培训的治疗师，您可以查看此提供者列表。
