Back in 2011, the field of psychology went into crisis. Some of the most famous and widely-cited experimental results — like the finding that powerfully posing for a few minutes gives you a hormonal boost in confidence, or that priming people with words to do with ageing makes them walk faster — could not be replicated by others. These were findings published in the field’s most prestigious academic journals, and going back for decades. Many of them had made mistakes in the experiments, through negligence, unintended bias, or simple error. A few, quite simply, had been faked. Whole swathes of research and media coverage, including some globally best-selling books, turned out to be based on foundations of sand. And since then, more and more scientific fields have turned out to have been the victims of replication crises.

早在2011年，心理学领域就陷入了危机。一些最著名和被广泛引用的实验结果——比如几分钟的有力摆姿势可以增强荷尔蒙的自信，或者用与衰老有关的词语来引导人们让他们走得更快——是无法复制的。其他的。这些研究结果发表在该领域最负盛名的学术期刊上，可以追溯到几十年前。他们中的许多人在实验中因疏忽、无意识的偏见或简单的错误而犯了错误。很简单，有一些是伪造的。事实证明，大量的研究和媒体报道，包括一些全球畅销书，都是以沙子为基础的。从那时起，越来越多的科学领域成为复制危机的受害者。

Nobody had bothered, for years and years, to go to the trouble of actually checking the more unusual and interesting findings. The Scottish psychologist-turned-science journalist Stuart Ritchie wrote an eye-opening book about the scandals in science called *[Science Fictions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Science-Fictions-Epidemic-Fraud-Negligence/dp/1847925650).* He and another science journalist, Tom Chivers, have also lately started a podcast to sort the reliable findings from the media froth, diving into the details of what scientific studies actually show — it’s called [The Studies Show](https://www.thestudiesshowpod.com/) (har har).

多年来，没有人费心去实际检查更不寻常和更有趣的发现。苏格兰心理学家出身的科学记者斯图尔特·里奇写了一本关于科学丑闻的令人大开眼界的书，名为《科幻小说》。他和另一位科学记者汤姆·奇弗斯（Tom Chivers）最近还创办了一个播客，从媒体泡沫中整理出可靠的发现，深入探讨科学研究实际显示的细节——它被称为“研究秀”（har har）。

But I’ve become increasingly worried that science’s replication crises might pale in comparison to what happens all the time in history, which is not just a replication crisis but a reproducibility crisis. Replication is when you can repeat an experiment with new data or new materials and get the same result. Reproducibility is when you use exactly the *same* evidence as another person and still get the same result — so it has a much, much lower bar for success, which is what makes the lack of it in history all the more worrying.

但我越来越担心，与历史上一直发生的事情相比，科学的复制危机可能显得黯然失色，这不仅是复制危机，而且是可重复性危机。复制是指您可以使用新数据或新材料重复实验并获得相同的结果。可重复性是指当你使用与另一个人完全相同的证据并且仍然得到相同的结果时——因此它的成功门槛要低得多，这使得历史上缺乏它更加令人担忧。

Historical myths, often based on mere misunderstanding, but occasionally on bias or fraud, spread like wildfire. People just love to share unusual and interesting facts, and history is replete with things that are both unusual and true. So much that is surprising or shocking *has* happened, that it can take only years or decades of familiarity with a particular niche of history in order to smell a rat. Not only do myths spread rapidly, but they survive — far longer, I suspect, than in scientific fields.

历史神话通常仅仅基于误解，但偶尔也基于偏见或欺诈，像野火一样传播。人们只是喜欢分享不寻常和有趣的事实，历史充满了既不寻常又真实的事情。发生了太多令人惊讶或震惊的事情，以至于只需几年或几十年熟悉特定的历史领域就可以闻到老鼠的味道。神话不仅传播得很快，而且它们的存在时间比在科学领域的存在时间要长得多，我怀疑。

Take the oft-repeated idea that more troops were sent to quash the Luddites in 1812 than to fight Napoleon in the Peninsular War in 1808. Utter nonsense, as [I set out in 2017](https://www.antonhowes.com/blog/were-more-troops-sent-to-quash-the-luddites-than-to-fight-napoleon), though it has been cited again and again and again as fact ever since Eric Hobsbawm first misled everyone back in 1964. Before me, only a handful of niche military history experts seem to have noticed and were largely ignored. Despite being busted, it continues to spread. Terry Deary (of *Horrible Histories* fame), to give just one of many recent examples, [repeated the myth](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Peasants_Revolting_Lives/kxnhDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1) in a 2020 book. Historical myths are especially zombie-like. Even when disproven, they just. won’t. die.

以经常被重复的观点为例，即 1812 年派去镇压勒德分子的军队比 1808 年在半岛战争中对抗拿破仑的军队还要多。正如我在 2017 年所说，这完全是无稽之谈，尽管它已被一再引用为事实自从 1964 年埃里克·霍布斯鲍姆 (Eric Hobsbawm) 首次误导所有人以来。在我之前，似乎只有少数小众军事历史专家注意到了这一点，并且在很大程度上被忽视了。尽管被查获，但它仍在继续传播。特里·迪里（Terry Deary）（因《可怕的历史》而闻名）在 2020 年出版的一本书中重复了这个神话，这只是最近的众多例子之一。历史神话尤其像僵尸。即使被证明是错误的，他们也只是这样。惯于。死。

Or take the case of the 12,000-franc prize instituted by Napoleon for an improved method of preserving food for the use of his armies, which prompted Nicolas Appert to invent canned food. It’s frequently cited to show the how prizes can have a significant impact. Except that, despite being repeated *hundreds* of times, it literally never happened. Appert was given money by the French government, but it was a mere reward in recognition of his achievement, given over a decade after he had invented the method. The myth of the food canning innovation prize is a truly ancient one, [which I traced back](https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-myth-busting-innovation) to a mis-translation of a vaguely-worded French source all the way back in 1869. That’s over 150 years of repeated falsehood, and I see no signs of it slowing.

或者以拿破仑设立的 12,000 法郎奖金为例，奖励一种改进的保存食物的方法以供军队使用，这促使尼古拉斯·阿佩尔发明了罐头食品。它经常被引用来展示奖项如何产生重大影响。除此之外，尽管已经重复了数百次，但它实际上从未发生过。法国政府向阿佩尔提供了资金，但这仅仅是对他成就的认可，是在他发明该方法十多年后才给予的。食品罐头创新奖的神话确实是一个古老的神话，我将其追溯到 1869 年对一份措辞含糊的法语资料的误译。这是 150 多年来不断重复的谎言，而且我没有看到任何迹象。它的速度正在放缓。

The persistence of historical falsehoods is easy to explain. Just as in science, there is simply no time to check absolutely every detail in the things you cite. And even if you do, you may have to follow a citation chain that is dozens or hundreds of links long. They will often end up with archival sources that would be too time-consuming to be worth going to the trouble of accessing. History, like any other field, very often relies on trust.

历史谎言的持续存在很容易解释。就像在科学中一样，根本没有时间检查您引用的内容中的每一个细节。即使您这样做，您也可能必须遵循数十或数百个链接长的引用链。他们通常会得到档案资源，这些资源太耗时，不值得费心去访问。历史，像任何其他领域一样，常常依赖于信任。

But it’s hard to trust when you are exposed to one of the most frightening of revelations: that hardly anyone ever bothers to check.

但当你接触到最可怕的启示之一时，你很难相信：几乎没有人愿意去检查。

I don’t think this is just me being grumpy and pedantic. I come across examples of mistakes being made and then spreading almost daily. It is utterly pervasive. Last week when chatting to my friend [Saloni Dattani](https://www.scientificdiscovery.dev/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile), who has lately been writing a piece on the story of the malaria vaccine, I shared my mounting ~paranoia~ healthy scepticism of secondary sources and suggested she check up on a few of the references she’d cited just to see. A few days later and Saloni was horrified. When she actually looked closely, many of the neat little anecdotes she’d cited in her draft — like Louis Pasteur viewing some samples under a microscope and having his mind changed on the nature of malaria — turned out to have no actual underlying primary source from the time. It may as well have been fiction. And there was inaccuracy after inaccuracy, often inexplicable: one history of the World Health Organisation’s malaria eradication programme said it had been planned to take 5-7 years, but the sources actually said 10-15; a graph showed cholera pandemics as having killed a million people, with no citation, while the main sources on the topic actually suggest that in 1865-1947 it killed some 12 million people in British India alone.

我不认为这只是我的脾气暴躁和迂腐。我几乎每天都会遇到犯错误然后蔓延的例子。它是完全普遍的。上周，我的朋友萨洛尼·达塔尼（Saloni Dattani）最近正在写一篇关于疟疾疫苗故事的文章，上周，我在与她聊天时分享了我对二手资料日益增长的偏执健康怀疑态度，并建议她检查一下她引用的一些参考资料只是去看看。几天后，萨洛尼感到震惊。当她仔细观察时，她在草稿中引用的许多简洁的小轶事——比如路易斯·巴斯德在显微镜下观察一些样本，并改变了他对疟疾本质的看法——结果证明没有真正的潜在主要来源时间。这也可能是虚构的。而且错误不断，而且常常令人费解：世界卫生组织根除疟疾计划的一份历史称，计划需要 5-7 年，但消息人士实际上说需要 10-15 年；一张图表显示，霍乱大流行已导致 100 万人死亡，但没有引用任何资料，而有关该主题的主要资料实际上表明，在 1865 年至 1947 年间，仅在英属印度就造成了约 1200 万人死亡。

Now, it’s shockingly easy to make these mistakes — something I still do embarrassingly often, despite being constantly worried about it. When you write a lot, you’re bound to make some errors. You have to pray they’re small ones and try to correct them as swiftly as you can. I’m extremely grateful to the handful of subject-matter experts who will go out of their way to point them out to me. But the sheer pervasiveness of errors also allows unintentionally biased narratives to get repeated and become embedded as certainty, and even perhaps gives cover to people who purposefully make stuff up.

现在，犯这些错误非常容易——尽管我一直很担心，但我仍然经常尴尬地犯这些错误。当你写很多的时候，你难免会犯一些错误。你必须祈祷它们很小，并尽快纠正它们。我非常感谢少数主题专家，他们会不遗余力地向我指出这些问题。但错误的普遍存在也使得无意识的带有偏见的叙述被重复并成为确定性，甚至可能为那些故意捏造事实的人提供掩护。

If the lack of replication or reproducibility is a problem in science, in history nobody even thinks about it in such terms. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone systematically looking at the same sources as another historian and seeing if they’d reach the same conclusions. Nor can I think of a history paper ever being retracted or corrected, as they can be in science. At the most, a history journal might host a back-and-forth debate — sometimes delightfully acerbic — for the closely interested to follow. In the 1960s you could find an agricultural historian saying of another that he was “of course entitled to express his views, however bizarre.” But many journals will no longer print those kinds of exchanges, they’re hardly easy for the uninitiated to follow, and there is often a strong incentive to shut up and play nice (unless they happen to be a peer-reviewer, in which case some will feel empowered by the cover of anonymity to be extraordinarily rude).

如果缺乏复制或再现性是科学中的一个问题，那么在历史上甚至没有人以这样的方式来思考它。我认为我从未听说过有人系统地与另一位历史学家相同的资料来源，并看看他们是否会得出相同的结论。我也无法想象历史论文会像科学领域那样被撤回或更正。历史期刊最多可能会举办一场来回辩论——有时是令人愉快的尖刻——供密切关注的人关注。在 20 世纪 60 年代，你会发现一位农业历史学家在谈到另一位农业历史学家时说，他“当然有权表达他的观点，无论多么奇怪”。但许多期刊将不再刊登此类交流，对于外行来说很难理解，而且通常有强烈的动机闭嘴并表现得友善（除非他们碰巧是同行评审员，在这种情况下）有些人会觉得匿名的掩护让他们变得异常粗鲁）。

This lack of effective institutions or incentives was really brought home to me recently by the publication of a paper in the prestigious journal *History & Technology* by Jenny Bulstrode of UCL, in which she claimed that the inventor Henry Cort had stolen his famous 1783 iron-rolling process from Reeder’s iron mill in Jamaica, where it had been developed by 76 black metallurgists by passing iron through grooved sugar rollers. It was a widely-publicised paper, receiving 22,756 views — eleven times as many views as the journal’s next most most read paper, and frankly unheard of for most academic papers — along with a huge amount of press coverage.

最近，伦敦大学学院 (UCL) 的珍妮·布尔斯特罗德 (Jenny Bulstrode) 在著名期刊《历史与技术》(History & Technology) 上发表了一篇论文，她声称发明家亨利·科特 (Henry Cort) 窃取了他著名的 1783 年轧铁机，这让我真正认识到了有效制度或激励措施的缺乏。该工艺源自牙买加的里德炼铁厂，由 76 名黑人冶金学家通过将铁穿过带凹槽的糖辊而开发出来。这是一篇被广泛宣传的论文，获得了 22,756 次浏览——是该杂志第二大阅读量论文的 11 倍，坦率地说，这对于大多数学术论文来说是闻所未闻的——还有大量的媒体报道。

Bulstrode argued that Cort had heard of the invention via a relative, the master of the ship *Abby*, who had been in Jamaica and in November 1781 visited him in Portsmouth; that in March-May 1782 Reeder’s mill was destroyed by the British army on the pretext that it might be used for weapons in a slave revolt during wartime, but that this was really at the behest of Cort to destroy the competition; and that the grooved rolling machines at Reeder’s mill were dismantled and sent to Portsmouth where Cort could use them.

布尔斯特罗德辩称，科尔特是通过一位亲戚、艾比号船的船长听说了这项发明，后者曾在牙买加，并于 1781 年 11 月到朴茨茅斯拜访了他； 1782 年 3 月至 5 月，里德工厂被英国军队摧毁，借口是它可能被用于战时奴隶起义的武器，但这实际上是在科尔特的要求下破坏竞争；里德工厂的沟槽滚压机被拆除并送往朴茨茅斯，科特可以在那里使用它们。

When I wrote about Bulstrode’s paper [last month](https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-cort-case?publication_id=18480&isFreemail=true), I noted that she had not actually presented evidence for the claims that received so much press attention — something that ought to have been picked up by the journal’s peer reviewers. She presented no evidence that there was any invention at Reeder’s mill, nor that an invention was derived there in the way she claimed. I pointed out that the grooves on sugar rollers were entirely different to those used in Cort’s iron process. This could be seen from carefully reading Bulstrode’s paper itself, and taking her citations (if not her claims) at face value.

当我上个月写到布尔斯特罗德的论文时，我注意到她实际上并没有提供证据来证明那些受到媒体如此多关注的说法——而该杂志的同行评审员应该注意到这一点。她没有提供证据证明里德工厂有任何发明，也没有证据表明发明是按照她声称的方式衍生出来的。我指出，糖辊上的凹槽与科特铁工艺中使用的凹槽完全不同。仔细阅读布尔斯特罗德的论文本身，并从表面上理解她的引文（如果不是她的主张），就可以看出这一点。

But things go from worrying to worse. After writing it, I was contacted by Oliver Jelf, currently completing a Masters thesis, who had actually bothered to go and check the main sources that Bulstrode cites, and has not only examined her interpretation of the sources in detail, but has [transcribed those same sources for anyone to read](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rp5ae/) and judge for themselves. Jelf notes that significant parts of Bulstrode’s story do not follow from the evidence she cites:

但事情却变得越来越糟。写完这篇文章后，奥利弗·杰尔夫（Oliver Jelf）联系了我，他目前正在完成硕士论文，他实际上费心去检查布尔斯特罗德引用的主要来源，并且不仅详细检查了她对来源的解释，而且还转录了那些相同的内容任何人都可以自行阅读和判断的来源。杰尔夫指出，布尔斯特罗德故事的重要部分并非来自她引用的证据：

> The sources instead suggest that ordinary and widespread ironmaking processes were in use at Reeder’s foundry; that no innovation occurred there; that the chain of events by which Cort is supposed to have heard of the foundry’s activities certainly did not occur; that Reeder’s foundry was destroyed because of the threat of a Franco-Spanish invasion force; and that no part of the foundry was removed from the immediate vicinity of the island, let alone taken to Portsmouth
> 
> 相反，消息来源表明，里德铸造厂使用的是普通且广泛的炼铁工艺；那里没有发生任何创新；科特应该听说铸造厂活动的一系列事件肯定没有发生；里德的铸造厂因法西联军入侵的威胁而被摧毁；铸造厂的任何部分都没有从该岛附近移走，更不用说运到朴茨茅斯了

In science terms, if you were to read those same sources before reading Bulstrode’s arguments, there is absolutely no way that you would derive the same conclusions as her . If you simply read the same primary sources that Bulstrode did and tried to create a narrative from them, I can’t see how you’d simply get anything more interesting than the following: “Reeder was the well-connected owner of a very ordinary iron foundry in Jamaica, which was profitable because it used slave labour and had very little competition on the island. In 1782, at the behest of panicked islanders, the military governor of Jamaica reluctantly razed the mill to the ground because of a rumoured imminent Franco-Spanish invasion, with some of the foundry’s weapons and ammunition temporarily brought onto British warships until the threat had passed. Oh, and in 1781 a distant relative of Henry Cort once sailed from Jamaica to Lancaster, which is nowhere near to where Cort was based in Portsmouth.” What I simply cannot fathom, now that I’ve read her sources thanks to Jelf’s transcriptions, is how Bulstrode arrived at her narrative at all.

用科学术语来说，如果你在阅读布尔斯特罗德的论点之前阅读相同的资料，你绝对不可能得出与她相同的结论。如果你只是阅读布尔斯特罗德所做的相同的主要资料，并试图从中创造一个叙述，我看不出你会得到比以下内容更有趣的东西：“里德是一个非常普通的公司的拥有者，人脉广泛。牙买加的铸铁厂之所以有利可图，是因为它使用奴隶劳工，而且在岛上几乎没有竞争。 1782 年，在惊慌失措的岛民的要求下，牙买加军事总督不情愿地将这座工厂夷为平地，因为有传言说法国和西班牙即将入侵，铸造厂的一些武器和弹药暂时运到英国军舰上，直到威胁过去。哦，1781 年，亨利·科特 (Henry Cort) 的一位远亲曾从牙买加航行到兰卡斯特 (Lancaster)，而兰开斯特 (Lancaster) 距离科特 (Cort) 驻朴茨茅斯 (Portsmouth) 的驻地相去甚远。现在我已经通过杰尔夫的转录阅读了她的资料，我根本无法理解的是布尔斯特罗德到底是如何得出她的叙述的。

What Jelf’s initiative reveals, I think, is a potential solution to at least some of the problems that history faces. Just as in the sciences it is considered good practice to make one’s data available, in history it should perhaps be a requirement to upload to some public repository the photographs or transcriptions of any cited archival sources that are not otherwise freely accessible online. This would not only help peer-reviewers assess a historian’s narrative — something that they frankly cannot do without going and reviewing those same sources for themselves — but would also hugely accelerate the rate at which historical work is digitised and made more available. You would not believe the sheer volume of photographs and transcriptions that thousands of historians have *already* made of various archival sources, which circulate only privately at best, but are usually never shared at all. We’ve already digitised so much, but have nowhere to put it — nor really much incentive to make it public.

我认为，杰尔夫的倡议所揭示的至少是历史所面临的一些问题的潜在解决方案。正如在科学中，提供数据被认为是良好做法一样，在历史上，也许应该要求将任何引用的档案来源的照片或转录上传到某个公共存储库，而这些照片或转录是无法在网上免费访问的。这不仅可以帮助同行评审者评估历史学家的叙述——坦率地说，如果他们不自己去审查相同的资料来源就无法做到这一点——而且还将大大加快历史作品数字化和提供更多信息的速度。你不会相信成千上万的历史学家已经根据各种档案来源制作了大量的照片和抄本，这些档案最多只能私下流传，但通常根本不会共享。我们已经实现了如此多的数字化，但没有地方放置——也没有太多动力将其公开。

Some of the more specialised journals still publish full transcriptions of newly-recognised archival sources, often with expert commentary and interpretation. You occasionally see it in some PhD theses still. It used to be very common in the late nineteenth century. But it really ought to be a matter of course, treated in the same way as a scientist’s data, and perhaps even revered. We need to change the incentives that historians face, so that making new sources available becomes one of the most lauded and rewarded things that they can do.

一些更专业的期刊仍然发布新认可的档案来源的完整转录，通常带有专家评论和解释。你偶尔还会在一些博士论文中看到它。它在十九世纪末曾经非常普遍。但它确实应该是理所当然的事情，像科学家的数据一样对待，甚至可能受到尊重。我们需要改变历史学家面临的激励因素，以便提供新的资料成为他们能做的最受称赞和最有价值的事情之一。

In the wake of the infamous 2011 replication crisis, a growing number of people have become actively concerned with how to shape the incentives and institutions that scientists face, to reduce the space for fraud, error, bias, and hype, as well as to improve the quality of science more generally — as much a movement as a field of study, allied under the label of “metascience”. I hope that history will see a similar movement. If we’re to maintain trust in historians, it could certainly do with it.

在臭名昭著的 2011 年复制危机之后，越来越多的人开始积极关注如何塑造科学家面临的激励措施和制度，以减少欺诈、错误、偏见和炒作的空间，并提高科学家的能力。更广泛地讲，科学的质量——既是一种运动，又是一个研究领域，被贴上“元科学”的标签。我希望历史能够看到类似的运动。如果我们要保持对历史学家的信任，这当然可以。
