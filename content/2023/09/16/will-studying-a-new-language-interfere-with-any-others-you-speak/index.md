## Multilinguals say it feels as though learning another language interferes with old ones. New research put this to the test

会说多种语言的人表示，感觉好像学习另一种语言会干扰旧语言。新研究对此进行了测试

When Julie Sedivy’s father died, she returned home to the Czech Republic and discovered another loss: Czech, her native tongue. In her [book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674980280) *Memory Speaks: On Losing and Reclaiming Language and Self* (2021), Sedivy, a language scientist in Canada, describes her experience with language attrition – the forgetting of a language once known, even one learned long ago. For her, language attrition felt connected to her learning English, which crowded out the Czech.

当朱莉·塞迪维（Julie Sedivy）的父亲去世后，她回到捷克共和国的家中，发现了另一个损失：捷克语，她的母语。加拿大语言科学家塞迪维在她的著作《记忆说话：关于失去和回收语言和自我》（2021 年）中描述了她的语言磨损经历——忘记一种曾经已知的语言，甚至是很久以前学过的语言。对她来说，语言消耗与她学习英语有关，英语排挤了捷克语。

‘Like a household that welcomes a new child, a single mind can’t admit a new language without some impact on other languages already residing there,’ Sedivy wrote. This is a frequent observation among multilinguals, that ‘Languages can co-exist, but they tussle, as do siblings, over mental resources and attention,’ as she put it.

塞迪维写道：“就像一个欢迎新孩子的家庭一样，一个人不可能接受一种新语言，而不会对现有的其他语言产生影响。”这是多语言者中经常观察到的现象，正如她所说，“语言可以共存，但它们会像兄弟姐妹一样，争夺智力资源和注意力”。

A recent [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17470218231181380) in the *Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology* provides some of the first experimental evidence of this process. The study included Dutch native speakers who also knew English, but not Spanish. The participants took an English vocabulary test, and each person was assigned 46 words that they already knew. Then, they learned half of those words in Spanish.

《实验心理学季刊》最近的一项研究提供了这一过程的一些初步实验证据。该研究包括以荷兰语为母语的人，他们也懂英语，但不懂西班牙语。参与者参加了英语词汇测试，每个人都被分配了 46 个他们已经知道的单词。然后，他们学会了一半的西班牙语单词。

After learning these 23 Spanish versions, the participants were again tested on all of the 46 words in English. Since they had already been quizzed on the English words once, participants were generally quicker to respond on this re-test. But, overall, they showed less of an increase in speed when recalling English words that they had also just learned in Spanish. ‘Hence,’ the researchers write, ‘we can conclude that learning words from a new language does come at the cost of at least retrieval *ease* for words in previously learnt foreign languages.’ In one of the experiments, learning the Spanish versions of words also seemed to make participants slightly less accurate when recalling those words in English.

学习完这 23 个西班牙语版本后，参与者再次测试了所有 46 个英语单词。由于他们已经接受过一次英语单词测试，因此参与者在这次重新测试中的反应普遍更快。但总体而言，他们在回忆刚用西班牙语学到的英语单词时，速度并没有提高。研究人员写道：“因此，我们可以得出结论，学习一门新语言的单词确实会以牺牲以前学过的外语单词的检索难度为代价。”在其中一个实验中，学习西班牙语版本的单词似乎也让参与者回忆这些英语单词时的准确性稍差。

Words compete in our minds, and a delay in retrieval could result from a person having to pause to select the right one

词语在我们的脑海中竞争，而检索的延迟可能会因为一个人不得不停下来选择正确的词语而导致

The experimenters examined whether giving the Spanish words a day to sink in would lead them to interfere more with the English versions, compared with when participants were retested the same day. But the delay didn’t make much of a difference in the results.

实验人员检查了与参与者在同一天重新测试相比，给予西班牙语单词一天的时间来理解是否会导致他们对英语版本的干扰更大。但延迟并没有对结果产生太大影响。

Past [studies](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-17618-013) have [suggested](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027720300378) that learning something new can drive out other information through a memory process called [interference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33610618/). As far back as 1900, researchers demonstrated this by asking people to learn and remember sets of words, such as ‘rose – window, horse – cloud’, and then new sets that had only the first item in each pair: eg, ‘rose – chair, horse – balloon’. People who saw the second list had more trouble remembering the first. Words compete in our minds, and a delay in retrieval could result from a person having to pause to select the right one.

过去的研究表明，学习新东西可以通过称为干扰的记忆过程排除其他信息。早在 1900 年，研究人员就通过要求人们学习和记住单词组来证明这一点，例如“玫瑰 - 窗户、马 - 云”，然后是每对中只有第一项的新单词组：例如“玫瑰” – 椅子、马 – 气球”。看到第二个列表的人更难以记住第一个列表。单词在我们的脑海中竞争，并且一个人必须停下来选择正确的单词，可能会导致检索延迟。

When new learning interferes with older learning, it’s called ‘retroactive interference’. This is common when learning more than one language, says Kristin Lemhöfer, the senior author on the recent paper, and an associate professor in psycholinguistics at Radboud University in the Netherlands. If you first learn that ‘dog’ is *chien* in French, and then you learn that it’s *perro* in Spanish, remembering *un chien* could become more effortful later.

当新的学习干扰旧的学习时，这被称为“追溯性干扰”。最近论文的资深作者、荷兰拉德堡德大学心理语言学副教授 Kristin Lemhöfer 表示，在学习多种语言时，这种情况很常见。如果你首先知道“狗”在法语中是 chien，然后你知道它在西班牙语中是 perro，那么以后记住 un chien 可能会变得更加困难。

One lingering question about retroactive interference is whether new learning can interrupt much older learning that’s been consolidated into long-term memory, rather than something learned more recently. This new study showed it’s possible; Lemhöfer was surprised that learning Spanish words impacted the recall of the English that the Dutch participants had learned many years previously. And interestingly, the experiments also revealed that interference can arise from simply learning a new language, whether or not it is used.

关于追溯干扰的一个挥之不去的问题是，新的学习是否会打断已经巩固到长期记忆中的旧学习，而不是最近学到的东西。这项新研究表明这是可能的； Lemhöfer 惊讶地发现，学习西班牙语单词会影响荷兰参与者对多年前学过的英语的回忆。有趣的是，实验还表明，简单地学习一门新语言，无论是否使用，都会产生干扰。

**After seeing this interference demonstrated** in the lab, Lemhöfer says it’s something that language learners should be prepared for: multilingualism may simply be taxing on the brain. Multilinguals have been [shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25625608/) to take longer to find and produce a word in any of the languages they speak, and they can [experience](http://www.bilingualism-matters.ppls.ed.ac.uk/languages-tip-tongue/) tip-of-the-tongue-states more often, she says.

在实验室中看到这种干扰后，莱姆霍夫表示，语言学习者应该为此做好准备：使用多种语言可能只是对大脑造成负担。她说，事实证明，会说多种语言的人需要更长的时间才能找到并说出他们所说的任何一种语言的单词，而且他们可以更频繁地经历舌尖状态。

Lemhöfer is German, spent a year in London, and then went to the Netherlands for her PhD – so she has plenty of firsthand experience with this phenomenon. ‘When I started to learn Dutch, my English was suddenly blocked,’ she says. ‘When I tried to speak it, a lot of Dutch words came out, which was embarrassing at times. It only disappeared once my Dutch became more stable, and I spoke more English again.’

Lemhöfer 是德国人，在伦敦呆了一年，然后前往荷兰攻读博士学位，因此她对这一现象有丰富的第一手经验。 “当我开始学习荷兰语时，我的英语突然受到阻碍，”她说。 “当我试图说出来时，很多荷兰语单词都出来了，这有时很尴尬。直到我的荷兰语变得更加稳定，并且我又开始说更多的英语后，这种感觉才消失了。

It may not be completely avoidable, but Lemhöfer thinks that these effects can be alleviated by continuing to use the language that’s being forgotten or interfered with. ‘Even though we did not empirically test that in that study, we strongly believe that the forgetting effects we observed can be avoided by continuing to use the other language, too,’ Lemhöfer says.

这可能不是完全可以避免的，但莱姆霍夫认为，可以通过继续使用被遗忘或受到干扰的语言来减轻这些影响。 Lemhöfer 说：“尽管我们在那项研究中没有对此进行实证检验，但我们坚信，通过继续使用其他语言也可以避免我们观察到的遗忘效应。”

For Sedivy, spending time in the Czech Republic and reacclimating herself with the language was awkward at first, but the words came rushing back – and parts of herself came with them. ‘English was the language in which I forged my independence, the language of my individuation,’ she wrote in an essay in 2015. ‘But it was in Czech that I was nurtured, comforted, and sung to.’

对于塞迪维来说，在捷克共和国度过一段时间并重新适应这种语言一开始很尴尬，但这些话很快就回来了——她的一部分也随之而来。 “英语是我建立独立性的语言，是我个性化的语言，”她在 2015 年的一篇文章中写道。“但我是在捷克语中得到滋养、安慰和歌唱的。”
