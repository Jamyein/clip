A reader asks: 有读者问：

> Any suggestions for dealing with especially pushy or overbearing people? I have a family member who’s constantly pestering me with their political views and trying to “convert” me to their position. I also have a boss who’s very pushy in the way she delegates tasks and projects—she’s kind of “bossy” in her communication and tends to micromanage with constant “check-ins.” I feel like I don’t handle these people very well but I’m also not really sure where to start doing things differently… I’m definitely a conflict avoider, so I’m sure that’s part of it.

> 对于对付特别咄咄逼人或专横的人有什么建议吗？我有一个家庭成员经常用他们的政治观点纠缠我，并试图让我“转变”到他们的立场。我还有一位老板，她在委派任务和项目时非常咄咄逼人——她在沟通中有点“专横”，并且倾向于通过不断的“签到”进行微观管理。我觉得我不能很好地处理这些人，但我也不确定从哪里开始以不同的方式做事……我绝对是一个避免冲突的人，所以我确信这是其中的一部分。

This question immediately makes me think of one of my favorite quotes:

这个问题立即让我想起我最喜欢的名言之一：

> If people keep stepping on you, wear a pointy hat.
> 
> 如果人们一直踩你，请戴一顶尖顶帽子。
> 
> — Joyce Rachelle 
> 
> — 乔伊斯·雷切尔

One of the things I appreciate about the quote is that it’s a reminder to stay focused on the things I can control rather than getting lost in thoughts about the other person, why they should be different, how unfair it all is, etc.

我欣赏这句话的一件事是，它提醒我要专注于我可以控制的事情，而不是迷失在对他人的思考中，为什么他们应该与众不同，这一切是多么不公平等等。

So, I guess the first thing I’d say is this:

所以，我想我要说的第一件事是：

**Always try to distinguish between where you want to control things and make changes vs where you actually have control and the ability to change things.**

**始终尝试区分你想要控制事物并做出改变的地方与你实际拥有控制权和改变事物的能力的地方。**

You can’t control how other people feel, for example, but you can always control what you choose to focus on.

例如，您无法控制其他人的感受，但您始终可以控制自己选择关注的内容。

That being said, I think there are basically three different approaches to dealing with pushy or overbearing people—and often a mixture is ideal…

话虽这么说，我认为基本上可以用三种不同的方法来对付咄咄逼人或专横的人——而且通常混合使用是理想的……

## 1\. Better Boundaries 

1\. 更好的界限

Setting boundaries means deciding how you will behave when people do something you don’t like. And while boundaries are mostly about you and your reactions, they can indirectly affect or change other people. Specifically, how you react to a pushy person’s behavior may—whether you realize it or not—be reinforcing that behavior.

设定界限意味着当人们做你不喜欢的事情时，决定你将如何行事。虽然界限主要与你和你的反应有关，但它们可以间接影响或改变其他人。具体来说，无论你是否意识到，你对咄咄逼人的行为的反应可能会强化这种行为。

For example, if you respond to your boss’s micromanaging by being passive and overly-deferential, you may be reinforcing their tendency to be pushy with you. On the other hand, if you were [more assertive](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/assertiveness/) and direct about not wanting to be micromanaged so much, they might be less likely to micromanage you because it doesn’t “work” for them as well.

例如，如果你对老板的微观管理采取消极和过度恭顺的态度，你可能会强化他们对你咄咄逼人的倾向。另一方面，如果你更加自信和直接，不想过多地进行微观管理，他们可能不太可能对你进行微观管理，因为这对他们来说也“不起作用”。

So, while I wouldn’t necessarily encourage you to expect that setting better boundaries can make pushy people better behaved, I think [setting good boundaries](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/healthy-boundaries/) can often make other people less badly behaved.

因此，虽然我不一定鼓励你期望设定更好的界限可以让爱出风头的人表现得更好，但我认为设定良好的界限通常可以让其他人的行为不那么糟糕。

## 2\. Acceptance 

2\. 验收

Acceptance is all about changing your own internal reactions to pushy people.

接受就是改变你对咄咄逼人的人的内心反应。

For example, if your politically overbearing family member sends you yet another “interesting” article about why So-and-So’s policies are destroying our country, it will likely lead to frustration and anger plus a lot of [ruminating](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/rumination/) and dwelling on why this family member is so obnoxious and aggressive in their views, why they can’t just keep things to themselves, etc.

例如，如果你政治上专横的家庭成员又给你发了另一篇“有趣”的文章，讲述为什么某某的政策正在摧毁我们的国家，这可能会导致你感到沮丧和愤怒，并大量思考和思考为什么这个家庭成员他们的观点是如此令人讨厌和咄咄逼人，为什么他们不能把事情留给自己等等。

An acceptance approach might entail [validating](https://www.thefriendlymind.com/validation/) your initial anger as understandable and normal. Then adjusting your expectations of your family member’s behavior… “They’ve always been like this, they’re unlikely to change, and me expecting them to be different isn’t productive (even if it makes me feel better about myself).”

接受方法可能需要验证你最初的愤怒是可以理解的和正常的。然后调整你对家人行为的期望……“他们一直都是这样，他们不太可能改变，而我期望他们有所不同是没有成效的（即使这让我对自己感觉更好）。”

## 3\. Avoidance 

3\. 回避

I often talk about how avoidance can be detrimental to our emotional health. Avoiding anxiety, for example, tends to only make us anxious about being anxious and therefore increases our overall anxiety in the long-run. Or, avoiding difficult conversations with our spouse might give some temporary relief in the moment but it’s at the expense of continuing to allow resentments to build up and fester.

我经常谈论回避如何损害我们的情绪健康。例如，避免焦虑往往只会让我们对焦虑感到焦虑，因此从长远来看会增加我们的整体焦虑。或者，避免与配偶进行困难的对话可能会暂时缓解一些压力，但代价是继续让怨恨积聚和恶化。

But avoidance can be healthy… Specifically, in situations where someone really doesn’t respond well to your boundaries and continues to violate them, or in situations where the stress of dealing with a pushy person is just so frequent and intense that acceptance seems untenable long-term, often it makes more sense to think seriously about how you can just avoid that person more often.

但回避可能是健康的……具体来说，在某人确实对你的界限反应不佳并继续违反界限的情况下，或者在与一个咄咄逼人的人打交道的压力如此频繁和强烈以至于接受似乎难以长期维持的情况下-术语，通常认真思考如何才能更频繁地避开那个人更有意义。

Put another way, boundaries are about changing your external behavior, acceptance is about changing your internal behavior, and avoidance is about changing your environment.

换句话说，界限是关于改变你的外部行为，接受是关于改变你的内部行为，而回避是关于改变你的环境。

For example: If your boss is just too pushy and doesn’t respond well to your boundaries, maybe it’s worth trying to get a transfer to a different department or even seeking a new job (conflict with managers is consistently among the top reasons people cite for leaving their jobs).

例如：如果你的老板太咄咄逼人，不能很好地遵守你的界限，也许值得尝试调动到另一个部门，甚至寻找一份新工作（与经理的冲突一直是人们引用的首要原因之一）离开他们的工作）。

Of course, for all sorts of reasons it can be difficult to make a major structural change to your life so that you don’t have to interact with someone as much or at all. But it’s important to keep this option open even if it’s uncomfortable to consider.

当然，由于各种原因，可能很难对你的生活进行重大的结构性改变，这样你就不必与某人互动太多或根本不互动。但重要的是要保持这个选择的开放性，即使考虑起来不舒服。

To sum up, the best way to deal with pushy people is likely some combination of setting better boundaries and practicing acceptance. But it’s important to remember that sometimes you may well have to make the difficult decision to drastically reduce or even eliminate your exposure to someone, as difficult as that might be.

总而言之，对付咄咄逼人的人的最佳方法可能是设定更好的界限和练习接受的结合。但重要的是要记住，有时您很可能必须做出艰难的决定，以大幅减少甚至消除与某人的接触，尽管这可能很困难。
